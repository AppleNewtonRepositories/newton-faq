<h4 id="IIA1">1) What are the various Newton models?</h4>

<p>Specifications and images of a number of different Newton devices can be found on David Arnold’s  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060612203134/http://archive.dstc.edu.au/newton/hardware.html">Hardware</a> page. (1996)</p>

<h5 id="IIA1a">a) Apple models</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Original MessagePad</li>
		<li>MessagePad 100</li>
		<li>MessagePad 110</li>
		<li>MessagePad 120 (Newton OS 1.3)</li>
		<li>MessagePad 120 (Newton OS 2.0)</li>
		<li>MessagePad 130</li>
		<li>MessagePad 2000</li>
		<li>MessagePad 2100</li>
		<li>eMate 300</li>
	</ul>

<h5 id="IIA1b">b) Third-party models</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Digital Ocean Tarpon</li>
		<li>Digital Ocean Seahorse</li>
		<li>Harris Access Device 2000</li>
		<li>Harris SuperTech 2000</li>
		<li>Motorola Marco</li>
		<li>Sharp ExpertPad PI-7000</li>
		<li>Sharp ExpertPad PI-7100</li>
		<li>Siemens NotePhone</li>
		<li>Schlumberger Watson</li>
	</ul>

<p>The Digital Ocean Tarpon and Seahorse were ruggedized Newton devices based on the MessagePad 130. Both models featured technologies such as built-in wireless networking, peer-to-peer voice communication, plus optional GPS. The Seahorse also included the first CDPD modem found in a personal digital assistant. The Tarpon was a modified and improved version of the Harris SuperTech 2000.</p>

<p>Also based on the MessagePad 130, the Harris SuperTech 2000 was designed for telecommunication field technicians, allowing them to access work orders and other information through the telephone system. The Harris Access Device 2000 was a similarly ruggedized device based on the MessagePad 2000.</p>

<p>The Motorola Marco was similar to the specifications of the MessagePad 100 and featured a wireless modem that used the Ardis wireless networking service.</p>

<p>The Sharp ExpertPad PI-7000 was equivalent to the Original MessagePad running Newton OS 1.0 or 1.1 and the ExpertPad PI-7100 was equivalent to a MessagePad 100 running Newton OS 1.3.</p>

<p>The Siemens NotePhone was developed for the German market and based on the Original MessagePad. It integrated a telephone, fax modem, and compatibility with PBX switchboards into a single package. Siemens also developed another prototype device using Newton OS called the Siemens Online Terminal. See question <a href="#IIA1k">IIA1k</a> for more information regarding prototypes.</p>

<p>The Schlumberger Watson was a vertical market device based on the MessagePad 2000 developed specifically for the French healthcare industry. The device included a modem and pair of smartcard readers to facilitate secure transactions such as processing claims and accessing patient records.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1c">c) Localized models</h5>

<p>The OMP 1.1, MP100, MP120 &amp; MP130 were available in German. The MP100, MP110 and the MP120/1.3 were available in French. The MP120/2.0-D ROM is in fact the same than the one in the MP130-D (except for the Gestalt answer about the kind of machine).</p>

<p>(From Carsten Lemmen) The OMP was available as a localized German model with 1.1 ROMs and factory preinstalled update to 1.11. This OMP could be upgraded (ROM replacement) to OS 1.3 (MP100 equivalent) through an Apple upgrade program in 1994. AFAIK there was also a Japanese Version of Newton OS, at least the Sharp ExpertPad (OMP clone) was available with Japanese localisation.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1d">d) Physical differences between models</h5>

<p>Here are some quick comparisons.</p>

<p>MessagePad 100, 110, 120, and 130 devices are smaller than the MessagePad 2000 and 2100.</p>

<p>MessagePad 100, 110, 120, 130 devices and the eMate 300 are equipped with only one PCMCIA slot. MessagePad 2000 and 2100 devices have two PCMCIA slots.</p>

<p>MessagePad 130, 2000, 2100 devices and the eMate 300 are equipped with a backlight.</p>

<p>The eMate 300 is equipped with a built-in keyboard.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1e">e) Specification differences between models</h5>

<p>Much of the following information was obtained from Pascal B. Kreil’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200924143402/http://newtonwiki.de/hardware/daten">NewtonWiki</a> and MSNUG’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060110162844/http://www.msu.edu/~luckie/newtgal.htm">Newton Gallery</a>.</p>

<p id="IIA1e8"><sup>8</sup> MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, and eMate 300 devices have a special connector known as the Newton Interconnect. This proprietary port can accomodate audio line in, audio line out, and two serial ports. Using a serial adapter (or dongle), the Interconnect can be converted to a standard DIN-8 serial port. [cf. <a href="#IIA1j">IIA1j</a>]</p>

<h5 id="IIA1f">f) I have a Newton model H1000. What is this?</h5>

<p>You have an original Newton MessagePad (OMP), the first model made, or you have an MP100, its immediate successor.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1g">g) I heard a rumor that Apple is making a new Newton. Is this true?</h5>

<p>That’s very probably just a rumor based on the interest of Apple for Palm devices. BTW, Palm Desktop which is to be found on iBooks is compatible with NCU (the format is like Claris Organizer).</p>

<h5 id="IIA1h">h) How can I distinguish a MP2000 from an upgraded MP2000?</h5>

<p>The difference between both is simply the DRAM size. If Apple upgraded the MP2000, there should be a MP2100 sticker near the interconnect port and the serial number. Otherwise, you can simply go to the Memory Info (press the [i] button under Extras) which should tell System RAM installed something close to 4 MB (3984 KB) if you have an upgraded MP, or something close to 1 MB if you have a MP2000.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1i">i) I have a Newton MP2x00/eMate 300 EVT/DVT or a Newton NotePad. What is it?</h5>

<p>EVT and DVT are two levels of prototype in the Newton program.</p>

<p>The initial prototypes were called “EVT” (Engineering Verification Test). After the EVT units were tested for a while, and various changes were made, the DVT (Development Verification Test) units were created. DVT units were supposed to be closer to the final production devices.</p>

<p>Initial EVT prototypes were similar to the final MP2K, except instead of the StrongARM processor, they had the ARM710 processor (same as the eMate).</p>

<p>A second batch of EVT devices (EVT 2) with StrongARM processors were built.</p>

<p>A batch of DVT devices was built. Most of the units were configured as the original MP2000. There were a few 4mb DRAM devices built in the DVT run (they therefore are like MP2100s). Besides, some units have a special ROM Board with an additional 8 MB of Flash for Internal memory (bringing the total to 12 MB). There may have been units with Flash instead of ROM and with 16 MB of ROM instead of 8.</p>

<p>The Newton NotePad were probably DVT units of the original MessagePad. It’s not known how they differed from the production OMPs.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1j">j) I have a grey dongle for MP2x00. What’s the difference with the black ones?</h5>

<p>Brian Parker reported on Usenet:</p>

<p>I have a very weird gray Newton 2K serial adapter! It appears to be exactly the same as the
normal black ones, except it is beige/gray and has “TAIWAN N 2” instead of China on the bottom.
It has the same part number as the black ones.</p>

<p>Don Vollum answered:</p>

<p>IIRC, the gray adapters were for the DVT (second batch of prototype) 2000 units (codenamed “N2”). [cf. <a href="newton-faq-hardware.html#IIA1i">IIA1i</a>]</p>

<p>The EVT units had black adapters, which looked like the production ones. Between the EVT 2 run and the DVT run, they changed one of the pins, hence the need for different adapters.</p>

<p>I believe that functionally, the gray adapter should be identical to a production unit.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1k">k) Where can I find information about Newton prototypes?</h5>

<p>There were several Newton prototypes. Some pictures can be found in MSNUG’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060110162844/http://www.msu.edu/~luckie/newtgal.htm">Newton Gallery</a>.</p>

<h4 id="IIA2">2) Where can I buy Newton MessagePads, eMates, and accessories?</h4>

<h4 id="IIA3">3) What is the difference between RAM, DRAM, Flash RAM, ROM, SRAM?</h4>

<p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is the designation for memory that can be both written to and read. ROM stands for Read Only Memory. ROM cannot be written to. It is used in the Newton for the operating system. Hence you cannot delete it.</p>

<p>SRAM stands for Static RAM. An SRAM cell consists of a small semiconductor circuit (a flipflop), that holds one bit of information. As long as power is supplied to this flipflop, it will retain its current state (unless changed intentionally, of course), hence the back-up batteries in SRAM cards.</p>

<p>DRAM is for Dynamic RAM. A DRAM cell is constructed to be a tiny capacitor. It is much cheaper to manufacture, and can be much smaller. However, the capacitor will slowly lose it’s charge, hence the need to refresh it regularly. Also, the needed time to (un)load the capacitor in order to store a bit of information is significantly longer than the time needed to (re)set a flipflop.</p>

<p>Flash RAM is based on EEPROM technology. It’s a kind of memory that does not lose its contents when power is no longer supplied. It is used for storage on the Newton.</p>

<h4 id="IIA4">4) What are the Newton’s sound capabilities?</h4>

<p>To record sounds, remember that you’ll need a microphone which can only be found on 2.1 devices.</p>

<p>Software which allows you to record and playback sounds:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Newton’s built-in recording stationary (MP2K only)</li>
	<li>VoiceNotes (by Modasys) dramatically improves the Newton’s recording quality, and uses memory much more efficiently than the built-in recording stationary, thereby turning the Newton into a useful digital recorder. <a href="http://www.modasys.de">http://www.modasys.de</a></li>
	<li>The freeware program ModPlayer by Roger Milne lets you play MOD files directly on your Newton. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Code/5100/">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Code/5100/</a></li>
	<li>Eckhart Köppen ported MAD, an MP3 player <a href="http://40hz.org/MADNewton/">http://40hz.org/MADNewton/</a></li>
	<li>There are also various sound packages available. Search UNNA <a href="http://www.unna.org/unna/sounds/">http://www.unna.org/unna/sounds/</a> for sounds such as:
	<ul>
		<li>StarWars/Babylon 5/StarTrek/Simpsons</li>
		<li>Shane Hill sounds: <a href="http://members.tripod.com/SDHEngSoft/">http://members.tripod.com/SDHEngSoft/</a></li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The freeware program VoiceAlarm by Serg Koren lets you record sounds which can be used as alarm sounds on the Newton. <a href="http://www.VisualNewt.com/">http://www.VisualNewt.com/</a></li>
		<li>Make-your-own audio adapter (Dave Miller). This site provides advice how to make a headphone jack for your Newton: <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~millerd/nicadapter/index.html">http://www.eskimo.com/~millerd/nicadapter/index.html</a></li>

<h4 id="IIB1">1) What kind of memory cards can I use in my Newton?</h4>

<h5 id="IIB1a">a) What cards are suitable for the Newton?</h5>

<p>You can use SRAM cards or Flash RAM cards. SRAM cards are more expensive than Flash RAM cards, and they need an internal battery.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of flash memory cards available today and in many different physical formats. There are ATA flash cards, CompactFlash cards, SmartMedia flash cards, memory sticks and linear flash cards. There are linear and ATA cards that can look the same externally, but only linear (or regular) cards can be used in Newton devices natively, and not all of them. [cf. <a href="#IIB1b">IIB1b</a>]</p>

<p>For ATA cards, you’ll need the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701200025/http://www.kallisys.com/newton/ata/">ATA Support</a> package developed by Paul Guyot. [cf. <a href="#IIB10">IIB10</a>]</p>

<h5 id="IIB1b">b) What sizes and models are suitable for my Newton?</h5>

<p>There are several common kinds of linear cards, depending on the chip used in it.</p>

<p>Please note that I compiled this table from various sources.</p>

<p>SRAM cards are said to only work if they are 4 MB or smaller.</p>

<p>It is believed that you need Newton OS 2.x to use flash cards bigger than 4 MB, however it appears to be wrong
at least with the Intel Series II+ in a MP100: Harri Hohteri succeeded in using such a card in his MP2100, his MP130 and his MP100.</p>

<p>It is believed that Series II+ only work in 2.x models, but Harri Hohteri’s 40 MB card works in his MP100.</p>

<p>The maximum size limit has been said to be 4 MB, 32 MB, or any other value. Apparently, there is no size limit but
the linear cards limit (64 MB), however nobody reported to have been able (or unable) to use a 64 MB card. If you do, please contact us.</p>

<p>Intel and AMD are technologies and most of the time suppliers of the chips, not brands. Therefore Intel cards can be sold
under different brand names (Apple for example ;-). You can identify them by their part number:</p>

<p>nn is the memory capacity in MB</p>

<ul>
	<li>Series II: iMC0nnFLSA</li>
	<li>Series II+: iMC0nnFLSP</li>
	<li>VS 100: iMC0nnFLSC</li>
</ul>

<p>The best source about Flash Cards is Carsten Lemmen’s website. His page about memory cards is available in English <a href="http://www.mac3.de/sig/newton/memory_cards.html">http://www.mac3.de/sig/newton/memory_cards.html</a> and in German: <a href="http://www.mac3.de/sig/newton/Speicherkarten.html">http://www.mac3.de/sig/newton/Speicherkarten.html</a></p>

<h5 id="IIB1c">c) Can I increase internal DRAM memory?</h5>

<p>You can increase the DRAM memory of the MP2000 by doing the MP2100 upgrade. Apple no longer do it. Some companies sell the kit or do the upgrade such as PixSolution <a href="http://www.pixsolution.com/">http://www.pixsolution.com/</a> &amp; Digital Dave <a href="http://www.kc.net/~drnewton">http://www.kc.net/~drnewton</a></p>

<p>You can expand both the DRAM and the Flash on eMate 300 to what the MP2100 has, by installing a NewerRAM
<a href="http://www.newerram.com/">http://www.newerram.com/</a> or another memory module.</p>

<p>[From Otto Sohn:] To my knowledge there is not a single manufacturer who still produces/stocks these cards. The only chance seems to be getting one on eBay. There have been rumors, though, that one of the manufacturers (I forgot which one — Lifetime ? Peripheral Enhancements ?) was possibly considering producing another batch if someone would buy their production of these cards wholesale. It was rumored to be 25+ cards minimum. I don’t know if that is true.</p>

<h4 id="IIB2">2) What kind of modem/ethernet card/mobile phone can I use?</h4>

<h5 id="IIB2a">a) Which modems can I use?</h5>

<p>Any compatible external modem should work properly.</p>

<p>[From Helmut Fischer]: To connect MP and external modem, use a standard Apple Macintosh modem cable. Works on all MPs I have tried (120, 130, 2100).</p>

<p>For internal modems, there is a complete list maintained by Len Lutz at: <a href="http://www.dca.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/lenlutz/newton.cgi">http://www.dca.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/lenlutz/newton.cgi</a></p>

<p>DNUG maintains a list of drivers and scripts: [dead link] http://www.dnug.dk/info/modems.html</p>

<p>To make a modem script, you can use the sample code provided by Apple, Modem Setup (latest version is 2), which you can find on UNNA.</p>

<p>Combo cards don’t work without a specific driver. Some have one, but most don’t. In the best case you can use the modem part of the card. If the Newton says “A communications card has been inserted” when you insert a combo card, it means that the modem part has been recognized and might work.</p>

<h5 id="IIB2b">b) Which mobile phones can I use?</h5>

<p>Here’s a summary of mobile phone compatibility for the Newton. Information on modems and drivers are below. Thanks to all the individual contributors who provided info about their mobile phones.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Motorola Micro TAC Alpha
	<blockquote>From: David Rouse — I’ve had excellent results with a Motorola “Micro TAC Alpha” (flip phone, on the larger side) and a CELLect 14.4 PCMCIA modem card (which has a neat geeky manual, it even covers UUCP). Both products are, I believe, as discontinued as the Newton itself.</blockquote></li>
	<li>Ericsson T18s
	<blockquote>
	From: Peter Hofmann — I use an Option 56k GSM ready card and Ericsson T18s with my MessagePad 2100. My Ericsson SH888 also was a good deal.
</blockquote></li>
	<li>Motorola Startac
<blockquote>
	From: D. Hochberg &amp; J. Leong — I’ve got a Motorola Startac with an Ositech 5 of diamonds modem. no problems.
</blockquote></li>
	<li>Motorola DPC650
<blockquote>
	From: Dave Fleishman — I have had some success with a Motorola DPC650, a MOT-1 cable from Megahertz and a Megahertz XJ4288 modem. Dials great, connects great, but the cellular connection is slow, and unless I’m near a cell tower, it can drop in the middle of the transfer. I used both the 14.4 and higher setting, and the CruiseCard 28.8 setting with success. I have also had success with a Motorola “black box” with just about all PC card modems I have used. Let me know if you need the part number for it, because I keep it in my car.
</blockquote></li>
	<li>Motorola 6200, 8200, 8400, 8700, 8900
<blockquote>
	From: Luca Falzoni — I’m using the CEllect 1+ card and a Newton 130 with a driver I found in a free database a year ago. (sorry, I don’t remember the URL) I put up a page with that information here: [dead link] http://jetai.unipv.it/falzoni/cellect.html Feel free to copy any information/driver from this page. I don’t know if the driver works with other models of Newton/cellect. I only tested these phones: motorola 6200, 8200, 8400, 8700, 8900 and flare. 100% ok with my CELLect 1+ card and MP 130.
</blockquote></li>
	<li>Nokia 2110 &amp; 2110(i)
<blockquote>
From: Orjan J. Larsson — Nokia 2110 and 2110i with an Nokia DTP-2 PC Card works like a charm with an Newton too. Also Options 33.6K PC Card modem with “GSM ready” logo onto them, with GSM cable for Siemens S4, works with Option drivers from www.novamedia.de. Both as a standard 33.6K modem and as a cellular modem. Haven’t tried anything else than an S4, but presume that, as you just change cable, it would work with any mobile phone that Option has an cable for. Both data and fax, in both cases, I might add.
</blockquote></li>
	<li>Nokia 6110
<blockquote>
From: Roman Pixell — I’m using the MP2000 today with a nokia 6110 and an option modem card. I rewrote the script, and it works ok I guess.

	<li>Nokia 880, 2110(i), 3110, 3810, 5000, 8110(i), 8146, 8148i — and clones like Technophone, some Philips models.
<blockquote>
From: Harri — Nokia 880, 2110(i), 3110, 3810, 5000, 8110(i), 8146, 8148i models works with DTP-2 ver.II Nokia Cellular Data Card and Nokia GSM ISDN driver. Nokia 880, 2110(i), 5000 (this might be Mobira Cityman not Nokia) and 2110 -clones like Technophone, some Philips-models work with DTP-2 Nokia Cellular Data Card and Nokia GSM Auto driver. These might work (and probably will) with each others drivers. The Nokia 6150 can be connected with TDK, option and some other third-party PC Card. These cards support several other brands and models. The Motorola 8700 — All Motorola phones which support Cellect PC Card are supported by GSM-Motorola driver. Some future and currently available phones which has built-in modem should be compatible. These phone are Nokia 7110, Siemens S25, Bosch 909. None of the phones above can use IrDA to communicate because of the incomplete IrDA support on Newtons. Obviously some Ericsson models are supported because there’s such thing as GSM-Ericsson driver available. I have no idea which phones.
</blockquote></li>
	<li>Sagem RD435
<blockquote>
Helmut Fischer has been able to connect his Newton to this phone using an Apple Modem cable (Mini DIN-8 &lt;-&gt; DB9) and connecting the DB9 part to a standard phone — PC cable. He reports: I had to modify the Apple cable slightly (remove the connection between RxD+ and GND).
</blockquote></li>
	<li>Siemens S25.
<blockquote>
From: Olaf “Holger” Bohlen — Today I connected my MP130 to my S25 GSM phone with a normal PC Data-Cable from Siemens and a Macintosh to PC Modem Adapter Cable. My configuration for the modem is: “Hayes compatible”, “serial”, and “no waiting for dialtone”. And it works great. I was able to fax, to mail and to phone :)

<h5 id="IIB2c">c) Which network cards can I use?</h5>

<p>(From Victor Rehorst)</p>

<p>For the 120/2.0 and 130, only one network card is known to work. Donald T. Stewart writes:</p>

<blockquote>I purchased the Roamer (a PC card wireless networking device) and a DynaCOMM Network Access Point from e-bay a couple of months ago, but just today tried to get them working. I have no trouble using a 2.0 MP120 with them, and seem to ba able to access my home Apple Talk network wirelessly.</blockquote>

<p>This card is seemingly incompatible with Newton OS 2.1.</p>

<p>Devices running Newton OS 2.1 and NIE 2.0 can use ethernet cards from certain manufacturers, with the proper drivers. The following is a fairly exhaustive list:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Farallon PN895 EtherWave</li>
	<li>3Com 3c589, 3C589B (according to Harri Hohteri), 3c589C, 3c589D (including -TP), 3CXE589DT, 3CXE589ET</li>
	<li>Proxim RangeLAN2 wireless Ethernet (this card is not compatible with AirPort or any other 802.11-based technology)</li>
	<li>AmbiCom AMB8010 PowerSaver</li>
	<li>TDK Combo cards: DFL5610, DFL3410, DFL3200, DFL9610</li>
	<li>TDK Ethernet cards: LAK-CD021, LAK-CD021AX, LAK-CD021BX</li>
	<li>D-Link DE-650, DE-660, DE-660+</li>
	<li>Fujitsu FMV-J182, FMV-J182A</li>

	<li>Melco LPC2-T</li>
	<li>Longshine LCS-8534TB</li>
	<li>Correga EtherII PCC-T</li>
</ul>

<p>Drivers for all of the listed cards are available from Victor Rehorst’s <a href="http://old.chuma.org/newton/ethernet/">Ethernet Information</a> page.</p>

<p>Note: This applies to TCP/IP. [cf. <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VB1e">VB1e</a>]</p>

<h5 id="IIB2d">d) How can I connect my Newton to a mobile phone?</h5>

<p>
Three solutions are available:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A PC card and a cable specifically designed for your Phone. Among other places, available from <a href="http://www.socketcom.com/product/dpc_card.asp">Socket Communications</a></li>
	<li>The serial cable for your phone from the manufacturer can be connected to the Newton using a Mini DIN-8 to DB-9 <a href="http://newton.pbk-solutions.de/produkte/kabel/adapter_seriell.htm">adapter</a>, and, in the MP2x00, the serial dongle.</li>
	<li>If your phone has an infrared comms port, you can try Eckhart Köppen’s <a href="http://www.40hz.org/Nitro/">Nitro driver. (Only Newton OS 2.1 devices)</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="IIB3">3) What kind of keyboard can I use?</h4>

<p>The eMate 300 has a built-in keyboard.</p>

<p>Apple made a optional keyboard which can be plugged into the Newton Interconnect port of a MessagePad 2000 or 2100 using an adapter.</p>

<p>You can also use the Newton keyboard with a MessagePad 120 running Newton OS 2.0 and a MessagePad 130.</p>

<p>There are hacks which allow this keyboard to be used with earlier Newton devices as well.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Newtkey is a keyboard driver for Newton OS 1.x devices. <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/gf2e/newtkey/">http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/gf2e/newtkey/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Information on using a Palm-compatible Stowaway keyboard with a Newton device can be found on Grant
Hutchinson’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180617092155/http://splorp.com/newton/stowaway">Connecting a Stowaway Keyboard</a> page.</p>

<h4 id="IIB4">4) Can I speed up the processor?</h4>

<p>Yes, PixSolution <a href="http://www.pixsolution.com/english.html">http://www.pixsolution.com/english.html</a> or
<a href="http://www.pixsolution.com/">http://www.pixsolution.com/</a> offers kits to speed up the MP2Ks and MP130s. They can install it.</p>

<p>From Harri Hohteri — For DIY (stands for do-it-yourself) guys there’s an article about accelerating MP120 by Lewin A.R.W. Edwards:</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.larwe.com/technical/accel_mp120.html">http://www.larwe.com/technical/accel_mp120.html</a>
</p>

<p>Stephanie Macks wrote two pages for homebrew MP2x00 (<a href="http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/2100fast.html">http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/2100fast.html</a>) and eMate
(<a href="http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/ematefast.html">http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/ematefast.html</a>) speed up.</p>

<h4 id="IIB5">5) Can I change the ROM of the Newton?</h4>

<p>Theoretically, the ROM of Newton MP 120 can be changed from Newton OS 1.3 to Newton OS 2.0. But you’ve got to find a ROM chip to do this. Other ROM chips on OMP and MP110 are soldered to the motherboard.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the ROM in an OS 2.1 device (MP2x00, eMate) is installed on a card, with room for four more ROM chips.</p>

<h4 id="IIB6">6) What kind of batteries can I use?</h4>

<p>You can use alkaline batteries, rechargeable batteries (NiCd, NiMH, etc.) or the Apple battery pack. The MP120 &amp; the MP130 can recharge them (with a little piece of paper to press the button under the batteries).</p>

<p>Please note that recharging NiMH batteries in MP1x0s can damage the Newton. [cf: <a href="http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk/2002-February/2503.html">NewtonTalk: MP130 Batteries</a>]</p>

<p>Only the Apple battery pack can be recharged inside the MP2k. For all other batteries you will need a separate battery charger, or to modify the battery holder as described by Nick Müller: <a href="http://www.logictools.de/newton/akku_mod/akku2k.html">http://www.logictools.de/newton/akku_mod/akku2k.html</a>.</p>

<h4 id="IIB7">7) What kind of power adapter can I use?</h4>

<p>The best advice is to use a power adapter that has been specifically designed for use with a Newton device.</p>

<p>Apple manufactured two different adapters:</p>

<p>The “Newton Power Adapter” (model H1300 in North America, model H2200 in Europe) is rated at 7.0V DC, 0.5A. It shipped with the Original MessagePad, MessagePad 100, MessagePad 110, MessagePad 120, and MessagePad 130.</p>

<p>The “Newton 9W Power Adapter” (model H0165) is rated at 7.5V DC, 1.2A. It shipped with the MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, and eMate 300.</p>

<p>There is also an “N2 AC Adapter” which is a prototype version of the 9W adapter with the same model number and power rating. The “N2” adapter accompanied pre-production (EVT/DVT) MessagePad 2000 and 2100 devices. [cf. <a href="#IIA1i">IIA1i</a>]</p>

<p>Both Apple adapters will work in any Newton device. The 9W adapter will recharge batteries faster than the original adapter, except when used with a MessagePad 100. See also: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA36628">Apple MessagePad Devices: Power Adapter Compatibility</a></p>

<p>It is not recommended that you use a third-party adapter. Too many users have inadvertently fried their Newton device using a non-Apple adapter. However, if you want to take the risk, remember that adapters need to be at least 6V DC, 400mA and the plugs are “tip positive”.</p>

<p>Jacek Jadwiszczak reported:</p>

<blockquote>With his MessagePad 120 and 130, he uses a 7V, 3W adapter. Both 7.5V and 6V work fine, but 6V will not charge batteries. Apparently, at least 3W is needed.</blockquote>

<p>Carl Schultz reports:</p>

<blockquote>I have been using a RadioShack AC adapter for almost a year now. It is the 3-12 volt adjustable model. The new model # is 273-1680 ($34.99 list) and is rated at 1000mA. Mine is the older 800mA model but otherwise is the same. The adapter came with several different plug ends, none of which was correct for my MP2000. I had to buy another one, which I don’t have the part number for, but it has a yellow end if that helps (they are all color coded). This end may now be included with the adapter, since the RadioShack description states that 4 of the included ends are “new”. Make sure that you install the connector in the “tip positive” configuration. I’ve been using mine daily at work with no problems.</blockquote>

<p>Michael Vacik reports:</p>

<blockquote>The RadioShack plug adapter to use is the <a href="https://www.radioshack.com/products/radioshack-adaptaplug-c">Adaptaplug C</a>.</blockquote>

<p>You also may want to review Johannes Wolf’s advice on NewtonTalk: <a href="https://marc.info/?l=newtontalk&m=102812823519465&w=2">Do I need the Apple AC?</a></p>

<h4 id="IIB8">8) What kind of printers can I use?</h4>

<p>Apple published this support article: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA35200">Newton OS 2.x: Supported Printers</a></p>

<p>There are basically three ways to print things from a Newton:</p>

<p>First, you can print with a serial connection (or an AppleTalk connection — LaserWriter-compatible printers only — or via IrDA if you have a MP2x00/eMate 300). For this, you need a driver. The Newton OS has drivers in the ROM which appear in the list when you select “Choose Other Printer” from the print dialog. There are also drivers written by Apple which can be found on UNNA for the SW4500 &amp; SW6500 and the HP IrDA printers (Newton OS 2.1 devices only): <a href="http://www.unna.org/unna/drivers/printer/">http://www.unna.org/unna/drivers/printer/</a> [I know there’s a non working one for Epson printers, but is there any other driver around?]</p>

<p>Apple also released a PrintPack which includes a serial/parallel adapter and which can print on several parallel printers. The list of printers can be found in the <a href="http://www.unna.org/unna/drivers/printer/PrintPack2/">PrintPack documentation</a> on <a href="http://www.unna.org/">UNNA</a>.</p>

<p>PrintPack 1 was a cable with the drivers included in it. PrintPack 2 requires the drivers to be on the Newton.</p>

<p>Without the hardware, the PrintPack2 drivers are useless. The serial/parallel adapter includes a processor and was manufactured by GDT Softworks (which later became InfoWave) for Apple. This company also manufactured compatible cables, the pre-V.4.X cables. A regular serial/parallel adapter will certainly not work.</p>

<p>About the GDT Softworks cables, Jon Glass reports:</p>

<p>I do recall there being a discussion that the last version of the GDT Softworks version of the PowerPrint adapter wouldn’t work with the Newton. I do know this, the one I have does work with my Epson 900.</p>

<p>I’m having trouble trying to decipher what’s written on the back, so I’ll include all the text:</p>

<p>Advanced Components &amp; Peripherals P/L<br>
Made in Singapore<br>
FCC ID KBVSPC1<br>
P/N: 590-0839<br>
Batch: SPC292<br>
<br>
LR99812</p>

<p>Finally, you you can also print using a PC and Newton PC-Print by Alexander Kunzer.</p>

<p>The HP Deskjet 340CBi is battery powered and has a Newton-compatible IrDA (Newton OS 2.1 devices) adapter.</p>

<h4 id="IIB9">9) Can I use digital cameras with my Newton?</h4>

<p>Yes you can. You need the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010805072031/http://www.compassinfo.com/tibet/">Tibet</a> software. This software is no longer supported, but Russell Tait (the creator of Tibet) gave away some registration codes you can use:</p>

<ul>
	<li>02FDAA084142</li>
	<li>02FDAA090E49</li>

<p id="IIB99"><sup>9</sup> Neal Sofge reports: “I have an Agfa ePhoto 780c, which is apparently an updated version of the 780 in an iMac-compatible blue case. It works with Tibet, but only if you ‘distract’ the camera by sliding the lens cover open and closed while trying to communicate with it. The timing on this is tricky, but you can get good at it after enough practice.”</p>

<p>It appears that some cameras that use the Fujitsu chipset (such as most of the Olympus models) are also compatible. More information is available on Eugene Crosser’s <a href="http://photopc.sourceforge.net/">Digital Cameras on Fujitsu chipset</a> page.</p>

<p>Canon cameras were once reported as compatible, but Daniel Padilla said they aren’t. At least not his PowerShot 350.</p>

<p>Daniel Padilla also reported that a camera needs to have the Sierra Imaging firmware and a serial port to work with the Tibet software. Here is the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000619203839/http://sierraimaging.com/support/supchimgex.html">list of supported cameras</a>.</p>

<p>The following cameras will definitely not work:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Apple QuickTake Series</li>
	<li>Kodak DC Series</li>
	<li>Connectix QuickCam Series</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="IIB10">10) Can I use a Click/IBM Microdrive/ATA Flash/CompactFlash adapter in my Newton?</h4>

<p>Yes. Paul Guyot developed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701200025/http://www.kallisys.com/newton/ata/">ATA Support</a>, a Newton package consisting of a driver and transactional database specifically for these types of storage cards.

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.kallisys.com/files/newton/ATA/ATA-Support-1.0.pkg">ATA Support 1.0</a> package. The <a href="http://www.kallisys.com/files/newton/ATA/ATA-Support-1.0-SourceCode.img.bin">source code</a> is also available.</p>

<h4 id="IIB11">11) Are there any third-party accessories that use the Interconnect port on the MP2x00 or eMate?</h4>

<p>At one point, <a href="http://www.enfour.com/newton/cables/">Enfour</a> manufactured on-piece serial cables that integrated an Interconnect port, eliminating the need for the Newton Serial Adapter.</p>

<p>You can build your audio in/out dongle. Details are at <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~millerd/nicadapter/">http://www.eskimo.com/~millerd/nicadapter/</a>.</p>

<h4 id="IIB12">12) Can I use an AirPort/WaveLAN card in my Newton?</h4>

<p>Yes. Just like an Ethernet card, you need an OS 2.1 Newton, NIE 2.0 installed, and the appropriate driver. The only available drivers so far is written by Hirochi Noguchi, and is available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ff.iij4u.or.jp/~ngc/eng/newtwave.htm">http://www.ff.iij4u.or.jp/~ngc/eng/newtwave.htm</a></p>

<p>The driver seems to work with most Lucent WaveLAN cards, and is designed to use a base station. Apple AirPort base stations with software version 1.3 or 2.0 are known to work.</p>

<h4 id="IIB13">13) What cable do I need to connect to my desktop computer?</h4>

<p>Portions of the following are from Apple’s <a href="http://www.unna.org/unna/apple/documentation/misc/AboutCables.pdf">About Cables</a> document. (1995)</p>

<p>You can connect to your Newton using either a serial cable or an ethernet card (connection from a 2.1 device to Mac OS computers only). Please note that using an Ethernet card means first installing the proper driver.</p>

<p>The MP1x0 devices and the eMate 300 have a Mini DIN-8 RS232 and LocalTalk compatible port. You can use either a Mini DIN-8 to Mini DIN-8 serial cable to connect to an old-world Macintosh (beige), a Mini DIN-8 to DB25 cable to connect to a DB25 Serial port on a Windows Box or a Mini DIN-8 to USB via an USB/Serial adapter to a new-world Macintosh. You cannot use IrDA with Apple Software. See section <a href="newton-faq-nos.html#IIIB3c">IIIB3c</a></p>

<p>The MP2x00 have an Interconnect port. Using a dongle, you can have a RS422/GeoPort/LocalTalk compatible port. You can
connect the same cable as with the other Newtons.</p>

<p>See section <a href="newton-faq-nos.html#IIIB3b">IIIB3b</a> for the various ways to transfer data to/from your desktop computer, software and hardware.</p>

<h3 id="IIC">C) Hardware problems</h3>
<h4 id="IIC1">1) Why does my Newton device whine when the backlight is on?</h4>

<p>Newton devices with backlit displays use the same technology that is found in Timex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiglo">Indiglo</a> watches, an Electroluminescent (EL) panel. This type of backlighting operates at a high voltage that requires a voltage conversion circuit, involving a transformer. It’s transformer which creates the whining noise. If you place an Indiglo watch up to your ear, you will hear a similar sound.</p>

<p>Apple Support Tech Note: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA40416">MessagePad and eMate: Noise Emission Levels</a></p>

<h4 id="IIC2">2) Why does my MessagePad 110/120/130 buzz or whine?</h4>

<p>If you are referring to the sound when the backlight is turned on, refer to <a href="newton-faq-hardware.html#IIC1">the previous question</a>. The humming or whine when the MessagePad is powered on is caused by the power manager circuitry. The sound may be more noticeable when the CPU is idle and devices are reportedly noisier than others. Unfortunately, there is no workaround. This issue specifically affects the MessagePad 110, MessagePad 120, and MessagePad 130 models.</p>

<p>Apple Support Tech Note: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA40416">MessagePad and eMate: Noise Emission Levels</a></p>

<h4 id="IIC3">3) What should I do if I have a hardware problem with my Newton?</h4>

<p>It has been years since Apple has provided repair services for Newton devices. You can either attempt repairs yourself or find another individual knowledgable enough to perform those repairs.</p>

<p>Frank Gründel of <a href="https://www.pda-soft.de/">PDA-Soft</a> has provided repair and refurbishing services for Newton devices for many years. <a href="https://www.pda-soft.de/en/email/email.html">Contact</a> him for more information.</p>

<p>You can also try some of the solutions that have been documented for frequent hardware problems. See section <a href="#IIC6">IIC6</a></p>

<h4 id="IIC4">4) Why does my Newton wake up at 3 AM?</h4>

<p>The Newton wakes up to move your to do items over from the previous day, and to perform other housekeeping. [From Robert Sexton’s FAQ]</p>

<h4 id="IIC5">5) How long will the backlight last?</h4>

<p>Alan Drogin says, It has a “half life” conjectured to be in the low thousands of hours. Which translates to at least a couple of years, which also means it doesn’t stop working, just gets dimmer, which ultimately means its within the normal limits of planned obsolescence accepted by the high tech world.</p>

<p>One thing I can’t give a definitive answer to is the actual half life. I’ve seen plenty of posts claiming that the half life of the MP130 backlighting is 1600-1700, but no actual proof of source. I’ve seen claims about the MP2K backlighting at 2000 and even 5000. John Schettino saw some web sites from backlighting manufacturers claiming 15,000-20,000 hour half lives. [From Robert Sexton’s FAQ]</p>

<h4 id="IIC6">6) Common hardware problems</h4>

<h5 id="IIC6a">a) My Newton won’t turn on. What should I do?</h5>

<p>There are a number of things you can try. Try the following, in increasing order:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Put in fresh batteries and plug in the Newton’s power adapter. Turn on the machine.</li>
	<li>With batteries or the power adapter installed, press the reset button. On the original MessagePad, MP100, MP110, MP120, and MP130, the reset button is visible when you remove the battery door. On the MP2000 and MP2100 the reset button is on the underside of the machine.</li>
	<li>For the original MessagePad, MP100, MP110, MP120, and MP130, replace the backup battery. Put in fresh batteries and plug in the Newton’s power adapter. Press the reset button.</li>
	<li>For the MP2000 and MP2100, press and hold the reset button for over twenty seconds. This is a special reset sequence for these machines.</li>
	<li>For the original MessagePad, MP100, MP110, MP120, and MP130, with the batteries or power adapter installed, press and hold the reset button down, then press the power switch. Continue to hold the reset button for two more seconds. Release the reset button. A dialog box appears asking “Do you want to erase data completely?”. Tap the “No” button. (You don’t want to erase your data!)</li>
	<li>For the MP2000 and MP2100 <em>only</em>, remove the battery, cards, and power adapter. Let the Newton sit by itself for a few hours. Leave it a whole day or a whole night if you can. You won’t lose any data. Then put in fresh alkaline batteries, and plug in the power adapter. Press the reset button. This procedure cures nearly every turning-on problem these models have.</li>
	<li>If you have an original MessagePad or a MessagePad 100, see section <a href="#IIC6e">IIC6e</a>.</li>
	<li>For the MessagePad 2000 and MessagePad 2100, <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/">Sean Luke</a> reports that one last resort you can try is to crack it open and see if its daughtercard has become unseated from its slot.</li>
	<li>If your Newton still does not wake up, consider posts to the newsgroups or mailing lists, or consider shipping the unit to Apple.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h5 id="IIC6c">c) How do I turn on the Newton’s backlight?</h5>

<p>The MessagePad 130, MessagePad 2000, MessagePad2100 and eMate 300 include backlit displays. Some third-party devices such as the Digital Ocean Seahorse and Digital Ocean Tarpon also sports backlit displays. [cf. <a href="#IIA1e">IIA1e</a>]</p>

<p>On a MessagePad device, depress and hold the power switch until the backlight is activated. Depress and hold the power switch again to turn off the backlight.</p>

<p>On an eMate 300, press the “lightbulb” button on the keyboard.</p>

<p>The backlight can also be controlled through software. See <a href="newton-faq-hardware.html#IIC6d">the next question</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h5 id="IIC6e">e) Why does my MessagePad 100 turn itself off as soon as I turn it on?</h5>

<p>Older MessagePad devices (in particular, the MessagePad 100) develop power-on problems due to gunk building up inside the power switch which increases its resistance. Sean Luke put together the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/projects/newton/MP100Power.html">The Newton MessagePad 100 Power-Off Page</a> with various workarounds and fixes.</p>

<h5 id="IIC6f">f) The serial port on my MP2000/MP2100 is caved in. What do I do?</h5>

<p>The serial port is poorly soldered onto the MP2K motherboard, and eventually it can wear out and cave in. If you are very, very good at solder, you might try opening the machine and resoldering the contacts. But it’s very difficult, and even proficient solderers won’t attempt it. Most likely, your only recourse is to have Apple fix the problem: see section <a href="#IIC3">IIC3</a></p>

<p>The chief culprit here is the Newton’s “dongle”, the small plug which connects to the Newton. The dongle has two bumps on the top and two bumps on the bottom, which help the dongle stay locked in the serial connector, but cause considerable friction and stress on entry and exit. To prevent problems in the future, you might try filing down the bumps on the top.</p>

<h5 id="IIC6g">g) My MP2000/2100 pen input is all messed up. What can I do?</h5>

<p>
This is a problem known as the “Jaggies”. The symptoms are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>invalid pen input, ie. you draw something and the Newton displayssomething totally different</li>
	<li>random pen input appearing when you draw or write</li>
</ul>

<p>
It can be caused by two things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>dirt that has collected between the lip of the case and the touchscreen. This can be aggravated by resting your hand on the case while writing, causing the dirt to trigger an unwanted “tap” on the screen</li>
	<li>a warped case that is exerting pressure on the touchscreen, thereby confusing the Newton’s calibration</li>
	<li>a damaged or oxidized touchscreen connector inside your Newton</li>
	<li>a damaged touchscreen</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you suspect that dirt is the culprit, you can attempt to clean between the case and the screen:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Remove any screen protectors that are installed.</li>
	<li>Take a thin card (such as a paper business card, nothing thicker than a credit or bank card) and gently insert a corner of it in the gap between the case and the screen. Run the card along all of the edges of the screen — the goal here is to remove any dirt particles that may be wedged between the case and the screen.</li>
	<li>Using a soft cloth, such as a lens or photographic cleaning cloth (not tissue paper!) wipe up the dirt that was dislodged.</li>
	<li>It’s probably a good idea to give the screen a nice cleaning now, before reinstalling your screen protector.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s possible that a warped case is the culprit and <a href="https://marc.info/?l=newtontalk&m=99928252123070&w=2">you can attempt to dewarp it</a>.</p>

<p>
If none of this does the trick, then either the touchscreen connector needs cleaning, or the screen must be replaced. Replacing the screen or cleaning the touchscreen should only be attempted by an experienced person, as it required almost complete disassembly of the Newton.

<h4 id="IIC8">8) Why does my eMate lid make a strange sound? Why does the screen look odd?</h4>

<p>There is a known design flaw in the eMate 300 lid hinge that can cause damage to the flat cable that connects the screen to the main board. More information about this problem and a solution to prevent it can be found on Joel Sciama’s <a href="http://www.inventors-emporium.co.uk/pages/newton-emate-hinge.html">Repairing eMate Hinges and Display Cable</a> page.</p>
