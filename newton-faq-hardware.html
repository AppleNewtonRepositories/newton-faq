<h4 id="IIA1">1) What are the various Newton models?</h4>

<p>Specifications and images of a number of different Newton devices can be found on David Arnold’s  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060612203134/http://archive.dstc.edu.au/newton/hardware.html">Hardware</a> page. (1996)</p>

<h5 id="IIA1a">a) Apple models</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Original MessagePad</li>
		<li>MessagePad 100</li>
		<li>MessagePad 110</li>
		<li>MessagePad 120 (Newton OS 1.3)</li>
		<li>MessagePad 120 (Newton OS 2.0)</li>
		<li>MessagePad 130</li>
		<li>MessagePad 2000</li>
		<li>MessagePad 2100</li>
		<li>eMate 300</li>
	</ul>

<h5 id="IIA1b">b) Third-party models</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Digital Ocean Tarpon</li>
		<li>Digital Ocean Seahorse</li>
		<li>Harris Access Device 2000</li>
		<li>Harris SuperTech 2000</li>
		<li>Motorola Marco</li>
		<li>Sharp ExpertPad PI-7000</li>
		<li>Sharp ExpertPad PI-7100</li>
		<li>Siemens NotePhone</li>
		<li>Schlumberger Watson</li>
	</ul>

<p>The Digital Ocean Tarpon and Seahorse were ruggedized Newton devices based on the MessagePad 130. Both models featured technologies such as built-in wireless networking, peer-to-peer voice communication, plus optional GPS. The Seahorse also included the first CDPD modem found in a personal digital assistant. The Tarpon was a modified and improved version of the Harris SuperTech 2000.</p>

<p>Also based on the MessagePad 130, the Harris SuperTech 2000 was designed for telecommunication field technicians, allowing them to access work orders and other information through the telephone system. The Harris Access Device 2000 was a similarly ruggedized device based on the MessagePad 2000.</p>

<p>The Motorola Marco was similar to the specifications of the MessagePad 100 and featured a wireless modem that used the Ardis wireless networking service.</p>

<p>The Sharp ExpertPad PI-7000 was equivalent to the Original MessagePad running Newton OS 1.0 or 1.1 and the ExpertPad PI-7100 was equivalent to a MessagePad 100 running Newton OS 1.3.</p>

<p>The Siemens NotePhone was developed for the German market and based on the Original MessagePad. It integrated a telephone, fax modem, and compatibility with PBX switchboards into a single package. Siemens also developed another prototype device using Newton OS called the Siemens Online Terminal. See question <a href="#IIA1l">IIA1l</a> for more information regarding prototypes.</p>

<p>The Schlumberger Watson was a vertical market device based on the MessagePad 2000 developed specifically for the French healthcare industry. The device included a modem and pair of smartcard readers to facilitate secure transactions such as processing claims and accessing patient records.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1c">c) Localized models</h5>

<p>The OMP 1.1, MP100, MP120 &amp; MP130 were available in German. The MP100, MP110 and the MP120/1.3 were available in French. The MP120/2.0-D ROM is in fact the same than the one in the MP130-D (except for the Gestalt answer about the kind of machine).</p>

<p>(From Carsten Lemmen) The OMP was available as a localized German model with 1.1 ROMs and factory preinstalled update to 1.11. This OMP could be upgraded (ROM replacement) to OS 1.3 (MP100 equivalent) through an Apple upgrade program in 1994. AFAIK there was also a Japanese Version of Newton OS, at least the Sharp ExpertPad (OMP clone) was available with Japanese localization.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1d">d) Physical differences between models</h5>

<p>Here are some quick comparisons.</p>

<p>MessagePad 100, 110, 120, and 130 devices are smaller than the MessagePad 2000 and 2100.</p>

<p>MessagePad 100, 110, 120, 130 devices and the eMate 300 are equipped with only one PCMCIA slot. MessagePad 2000 and 2100 devices have two PCMCIA slots.</p>

<p>MessagePad 130, 2000, 2100 devices and the eMate 300 are equipped with a backlight.</p>

<p>The eMate 300 is equipped with a built-in keyboard.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1e">e) Specification differences between models</h5>

<p>Much of the following information was obtained from Pascal B. Kreil’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200924143402/http://newtonwiki.de/hardware/daten">NewtonWiki</a> and MSNUG’s <a href="http://cf.psl.msu.edu/newtgal.htm">Newton Gallery</a>.</p>

<p id="IIA1e-8"><sup>8</sup> MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, and eMate 300 devices have a special connector known as the Newton Interconnect Port. This proprietary port can accomodate audio line in, audio line out, and two serial ports. Using a serial adapter (or dongle), the Interconnect can be converted to a standard DIN-8 serial port.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="#IIA1k">What makes a grey Newton Serial Adapter different from a black one?</a></p>

<h5 id="IIA1f">f) I have a Newton model H1000. What is this?</h5>

<p>You have an original Newton MessagePad (OMP), the first model made, or you have an MP100, its immediate successor.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1g">g) Is Apple releasing a new Newton?</h5>

<p>Nope. This was a rumour based on rumblings that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/02/6140-2/">Apple was interested in acquiring Palm</a> back in 2006.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1h">h) How can I tell an original MessagePad 2000 from an upgraded model?</h5>

<p>The main difference is the amount of DRAM installed in the device. To check this, tap the “i” button in Extras and select “Memory Info”. An original MessagePad 2000 will show approximately 1 MB (~916 KB) of System RAM installed. An upgraded MessagePad 2000 will show approximately 4 MB (~3,980 KB) of System RAM installed.</p>

<p>Also, if Apple upgraded the MessagePad 2000, there should be a sticker next to the Interconnect port that reads “MP2100”.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1i">i) I have a Newton NotePad. What is it?</h5>

<p>The Newton NotePad was a pre-production version of the original MessagePad (OMP). It’s not known how (or even if) the NotePad differed from the production OMP devices.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1j">j) I have a Newton device marked as an “EVT” or “DVT”. What is it?</h5>

<p>Pre-production prototype Newton devices were often referred to as an Engineering Verification Test or “EVT”. After EVT devices had been put through various tests and subsequently updated with changes to the hardware, a Development Verification Test or “DVT” device would be produced. DVT devices were supposedly very close to the final production devices.</p>

<p>During the development of the MessagePad 2000, an ARM 710 processor (like the one found in the eMate 300) was used in the EVT, instead of a StrongARM processor. The second round of MessagePad 2000 EVT devices (EVT 2) used the StrongARM processor.</p>

<p>Most of the MessagePad 2000 DVT devices were configured exactly the same as the production MessagePad 2000. It has been reported that a few of the DVT devices included 4 MB of DRAM instead of the standard 1 MB. Likewise, some DVT devices apparently have a special ROM board with an additional 8 MB of DRAM, bringing the total to 12 MB. There also may have been devices that used 16 MB of Flash RAM instead of the typical 8 MB of ROM.</p>

<p>Needless to say, many of these details still need to be verified.</p>

<h5 id="IIA1k">k) What makes a grey Newton Serial Adapter different from a black one?</h5>

<p>The Newton Serial Adapter is a “dongle” which converts the proprietary Interconnect port on MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, and eMate 300 devices to a standard Mini DIN-8 connector.</p>

<p>There are four known variations of the adapter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Black plastic, stamped “Taiwan N 1”</li>
	<li>Grey plastic, stamped “Taiwan N 2”</li>
	<li>Black plastic, stamped “China N 1”</li>
	<li>Black plastic, stamped “China N 2”</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the “N” in the stamped text is actually a box with a diagonal line, not an “N” at all. At one point, it was thought that the “N 2” referred to the “N2” codename of the MessagePad 2000. It’s highly likely that this is just a coincidence, since there are “N 1” dongles as well.</p>

<p>All variations have the part number “590-0756” stamped into the plastic housing.</p>

<p>The grey version of the adapter was specific to the pre-production “DVT” (Development Verification Test) version of the MessagePad 2000.</p>

<p>The earlier “EVT” (Engineering Verification Test) devices had black adapters, just like the production version. However, between the second run of EVT devices and the DVT release, they changed one of the pins in the Interconnect port, requiring the need for different adapters.</p>

<p>Don Vollum reported that the grey adapter should be functionally and electrically identical to a black production adapter. However, this has yet to be verified.</p>

<p>Grant Hutchinson theorizes that the prototype and test versions of the dongle were manufactured in Taiwan, whereas the consumer production dongles were manufactured in China. This might explain the different text stamped into the adapters.</p>

<h4 id="IIA3">3) What is the difference between RAM, DRAM, Flash RAM, ROM, SRAM?</h4>

<p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is the designation for memory that can be both written to and read. ROM stands for Read Only Memory. ROM cannot be written to. It is used in the Newton for the operating system. Hence you cannot delete it.</p>

<p>SRAM stands for Static RAM. An SRAM cell consists of a small semiconductor circuit (a flipflop), that holds one bit of information. As long as power is supplied to this flipflop, it will retain its current state (unless changed intentionally, of course), hence the back-up batteries in SRAM cards.</p>

<p>DRAM is for Dynamic RAM. A DRAM cell is constructed to be a tiny capacitor. It is much cheaper to manufacture, and can be much smaller. However, the capacitor will slowly lose it’s charge, hence the need to refresh it regularly. Also, the needed time to (un)load the capacitor in order to store a bit of information is significantly longer than the time needed to (re)set a flipflop.</p>

<p>Flash RAM is based on EEPROM technology. It’s a kind of memory that does not lose its contents when power is no longer supplied. It is used for storage on the Newton.</p>

<h4 id="IIA4">4) What are the sound capabilities of the Newton?</h4>

<p>The Original MessagePad, MessagePad 100, MessagePad 110, MessagePad 120, and MessagePad 130 support 8-bit mono audio, up to a 22,050 Hz sample rate. These devices have a small speaker located near the bottom of the device.</p>

<p>The MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, and eMate 300 support 16-bit mono audio and have a slightly larger integral speaker.</p>

<p>The MessagePad 2000 and MessagePad 2100 also have a built-in microphone to support audio recording.</p>

<p>The eMate 300 has a standard 3.5 mm jack for audio output, primarily used for headphones.</p>

<p>All three of these devices can support audio line in and audio line out by using an adapter that plugs into Interconnect port. [cf. <a href="#IIB11">IIB11</a>]</p>

<p>There are several software packages available to allow you to play and record audio. [cf. <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VF1">VF1</a> &amp; <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VF2">VF2</a>]</p>

<h4 id="IIB1">1) Storage Cards &amp; Memory</h4>

<h5 id="IIB1a">a) What type of storage cards can I use?</h5>

<p>The Newton supports SRAM (Static RAM) and Linear Flash RAM storage cards by default.</p>

<p>SRAM cards need an internal backup battery to retain their data when not inserted in a device. Linear Flash RAM cards do not require batteries.</p>

<p>ATA-based storage cards can be used with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701200025/http://www.kallisys.com/newton/ata/">ATA Support</a> package developed by Paul Guyot. ATA Support consists of a driver and transactional database specifically for handling these types of storage cards.</p>

<h5 id="IIB1b">b) Which storage cards are compatible with my Newton?</h5>

<p>There are several common kinds of linear cards, depending on the chip used in it.</p>

<p>SRAM cards are said to only work if they are 4 MB or smaller.</p>

<p>It is believed that you need Newton OS 2.x to use flash cards bigger than 4 MB, however it appears to be wrong at least with the Intel Series II+ in a MessagePad 100. Harri Hohteri succeeded in using such a card in his MessagePad 2100, MessagePad 130, and MessagePad 100.</p>

<p>It is believed that Series II+ only work in 2.x models. However, once again Harri Hohteri reported that his 40 MB card works in a MessagePad 100.</p>

<p>The maximum size limit has been said to be 4 MB, 32 MB, or any other value. Apparently, there is no size limit but the linear cards limit (64 MB), however nobody reported to have been able (or unable) to use a 64 MB card. If you do, please contact us.</p>

<p>Intel and AMD are suppliers of the chips used in these cards. Therefore Intel cards are sold under different brand names. You can identify them by their model numbers:</p>

<p>The ‘<em>nn</em>’ portion of the model number is the memory capacity (MB) of the card.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Series II: iMC0<em>nn</em>FLSA</li>
	<li>Series II+: iMC0<em>nn</em>FLSP</li>
	<li>VS 100: iMC0<em>nn</em>FLSC</li>

<h5 id="IIB1c">c) Can I increase the internal memory of my Newton?</h5>

<p>You can increase the DRAM memory of the MessagePad 2000 by performing a MessagePad 2100 upgrade, however Apple no longer offers this service.</p>

<p>Some third-parties sold upgrade kits and offered upgrade services, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030807200932/http://www.pixsolution.com/">PIXsolution</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080708205424/http://www.kc.net/~drnewton">Dave “Dr. Newton” Watson</a>. Occasionally these upgrades appear on eBay or for sale through the <a href="http://newtontalk.net/">NewtonTalk</a> mailing list.</p>

<p>Abe Lee provided instructions for a do-it-yourself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010602033135/http://user.chollian.net/~cehz/frame2.htm">MessagePad 2000 upgrade</a>, although the images are unfortunately missing.</p>

<p>At one time, you could also purchase Newer Technology’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980527040433/http://www.newerram.com/configs/emate.html">eMate 300 Memory Module</a>, which expanded both the DRAM and Flash RAM to the equivilent of an MessagePad 2100.</p>

<h4 id="IIB2">2) Networking &amp; Connectivity</h4>

<h5 id="IIB2a">a) Which modems can I use?</h5>

<p>Any external modem should work properly, using a standard DIN-8 serial cable to connect to the Newton device.</p>

<p>Until 2003, Len Lutz maintained the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040409081724/http://www.dca.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/lenlutz/newton.cgi">Newton Modem List</a>, a voluminous database of PCMCIA modems that people had used with their Newton devices.</p>

<p>According to Victor Rehorst, most PCMCIA modems should work as long as they are not labelled as a “software modem” or “Winmodem”.</p>

<p>Note that “combo” cards (PCMCIA cards that combine a modem with some other sort of networking protocol, such as ethernet) generally require a specific driver to operate. However, in many cases the modem will work with a Newton device. If a message appears stating “A communications card has been inserted” when you insert a combo card, the modem component of the card has been recognized and just might work.</p>

<p>At one point, DNUG maintained a list of various <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990210065102/http://www.dnug.dk/info/modems.html">modem drivers and scripts</a>.</p>

<p>To create your own modem script, you can use Apple’s Newton Toolkit sample code.</p>

<h5 id="IIB2b">b) Which mobile phones can I use?</h5>

<p>Here’s a summary of mobile phone compatibility for the Newton. Information on modems and drivers are below. Thanks to all the individual contributors who provided info about their mobile phones.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Motorola Micro TAC Alpha
		<blockquote>From: David Rouse — I’ve had excellent results with a Motorola “Micro TAC Alpha” (flip phone, on the larger side) and a CELLect 14.4 PCMCIA modem card (which has a neat geeky manual, it even covers UUCP). Both products are, I believe, as discontinued as the Newton itself.</blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Ericsson T18s
		<blockquote>From: Peter Hofmann — I use an Option 56k GSM ready card and Ericsson T18s with my MessagePad 2100. My Ericsson SH888 also was a good deal.</blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Motorola Startac
		<blockquote>From: D. Hochberg &amp; J. Leong — I’ve got a Motorola Startac with an Ositech 5 of diamonds modem. no problems.</blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Motorola DPC650
		<blockquote>From: Dave Fleishman — I have had some success with a Motorola DPC650, a MOT-1 cable from Megahertz and a Megahertz XJ4288 modem. Dials great, connects great, but the cellular connection is slow, and unless I’m near a cell tower, it can drop in the middle of the transfer. I used both the 14.4 and higher setting, and the CruiseCard 28.8 setting with success. I have also had success with a Motorola “black box” with just about all PC card modems I have used. Let me know if you need the part number for it, because I keep it in my car.</blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Motorola 6200, 8200, 8400, 8700, 8900
		<blockquote>From: Luca Falzoni — I’m using the CEllect 1+ card and a Newton 130 with a driver I found in a free database a year ago. (sorry, I don’t remember the URL) I put up a page with that information here: [dead link] http://jetai.unipv.it/falzoni/cellect.html Feel free to copy any information/driver from this page. I don’t know if the driver works with other models of Newton/cellect. I only tested these phones: motorola 6200, 8200, 8400, 8700, 8900 and flare. 100% ok with my CELLect 1+ card and MP 130.</blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Nokia 2110 &amp; 2110(i)
		<blockquote>From: Orjan J. Larsson — Nokia 2110 and 2110i with an Nokia DTP-2 PC Card works like a charm with an Newton too. Also Options 33.6K PC Card modem with “GSM ready” logo onto them, with GSM cable for Siemens S4, works with Option drivers from www.novamedia.de. Both as a standard 33.6K modem and as a cellular modem. Haven’t tried anything else than an S4, but presume that, as you just change cable, it would work with any mobile phone that Option has an cable for. Both data and fax, in both cases, I might add.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>From: Harri — Nokia 880, 2110(i), 3110, 3810, 5000, 8110(i), 8146, 8148i models works with DTP-2 ver.II Nokia Cellular Data Card and Nokia GSM ISDN driver. Nokia 880, 2110(i), 5000 (this might be Mobira Cityman not Nokia) and 2110 -clones like Technophone, some Philips-models work with DTP-2 Nokia Cellular Data Card and Nokia GSM Auto driver. These might work (and probably will) with each others drivers. The Nokia 6150 can be connected with TDK, option and some other third-party PC Card. These cards support several other brands and models. The Motorola 8700 — All Motorola phones which support Cellect PC Card are supported by GSM-Motorola driver. Some future and currently available phones which has built-in modem should be compatible. These phone are Nokia 7110, Siemens S25, Bosch 909. None of the phones above can use IrDA to communicate because of the incomplete IrDA support on Newton devices. Obviously some Ericsson models are supported because there’s such thing as GSM-Ericsson driver available. I have no idea which phones.</blockquote>

	<li>Sagem RD435
		<blockquote>Helmut Fischer has been able to connect his Newton to this phone using an Apple Modem cable (Mini DIN-8 &lt;-&gt; DB9) and connecting the DB9 part to a standard phone — PC cable. He reports: I had to modify the Apple cable slightly (remove the connection between RxD+ and GND).</blockquote>

<h5 id="IIB2c">c) Which network cards can I use?</h5>

<p>For the MessagePad 120 with Newton OS 2.0 and MessagePad 130, only one network card is known to work.</p>

<p>According to Donald T. Stewart:</p>

<blockquote>“I purchased the Roamer (wireless networking PC card) and a DynaCOMM Network Access Point from eBay a couple of months ago, but just today tried to get them working. I had no trouble using an MessagePad 120/2.0 with them and seem to be able to access my home AppleTalk network wirelessly.”</blockquote>

<p>The Roamer card is apparently not compatible with Newton OS 2.1.</p>

<p>Devices running Newton OS 2.1 and Newton Internet Enabler (NIE) 2.0 can use ethernet and <a href="#IIB12">wireless cards</a> from certain manufacturers with the proper drivers.</p>

<p>The following is a fairly exhaustive list of compatible ethernet cards:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Farallon PN895 EtherWave</li>
	<li>3Com 3c589, 3C589B, 3c589C, 3c589D, 3c589D-TP, 3CXE589DT, 3CXE589ET</li>
	<li>Proxim RangeLAN2 <sup><a href="#IIB2c-9">9</a></sup></li>

<h5 id="IIB2d">d) How can I connect my Newton to a mobile phone?</h5>

<p>Three solutions are available:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A PC card and a cable specifically designed for your Phone. Among other places, available from <a href="http://www.socketcom.com/product/dpc_card.asp">Socket Communications</a></li>
	<li>The serial cable for your phone from the manufacturer can be connected to the Newton using a Mini DIN-8 to DB-9 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040806154001/http://newton.pbk-solutions.de/produkte/kabel/adapter_seriell.htm">adapter</a> and, in the MP2x00, the serial dongle.</li>
	<li>If your phone has an infrared comms port, you can try Eckhart Köppen’s <a href="http://www.40hz.org/Nitro/">Nitro driver. (Only Newton OS 2.1 devices)</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="IIB3">3) What kind of keyboard can I use?</h4>

<p>The eMate 300 has a built-in keyboard.</p>

<p>Apple made a optional keyboard which can be plugged into the Interconnect port of a MessagePad 2000 or 2100 using an adapter.</p>

<p>You can also use the Newton keyboard with a MessagePad 120 running Newton OS 2.0 and a MessagePad 130.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070128134449/http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/gf2e/newtkey/">Newtkey</a> allows a Newton keyboard to be used with Newton OS 1.x devices.</p>

<p>Information on using a Palm-compatible Stowaway keyboard with a Newton device can be found on Grant Hutchinson’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180617092155/http://splorp.com/newton/stowaway">Connecting a Stowaway Keyboard</a> page.</p>

<p>Various desktop connection applications allow you to use your computer keyboard to enter data into a Newton device. [cf. <a href="#IIIB3b">IIIB3b</a>]</p>

<h4 id="IIB4">4) Can I speed up the processor?</h4>

<p>At one point in time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030807200932/http://www.pixsolution.com/">PIXsolution</a> offered kits and installation services to speed up MessagePad 130, MessagePad 2000, and MessagePad 2100 devices. These upgrades are very hard to find nowadays.</p>

<p>However, if you’re feeling handy with a soldering iron, there are several ways to speed things up yourself.</p>

<p>Lewin A.R.W. Edwards’ <a href="http://www.larwe.com/technical/accel_mp120.html">Accelerating the Newton MessagePad 120</a> describes how to replace the clock oscillator module (oscmod) to gain a few extra megahertz.</p>

<p>Likewise, Stephanie Maksylewich provides plenty of information in her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080802003243/http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/2100fast.html">MP2x00 Overclock</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080619042908/http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/ematefast.html">eMate Overclock</a> projects.</p>

<p>Ed Kummel also documents the process to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071221093808/http://newton.tek-ed.com/newtspeed/">Speed up your MP2000!</a></p>

<h4 id="IIB5">5) Can I change the ROM of the Newton?</h4>

<p>Theoretically, the ROM of Newton MP 120 can be changed from Newton OS 1.3 to Newton OS 2.0. But you’ve got to find a ROM chip to do this. Other ROM chips on OMP and MP110 are soldered to the motherboard.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the ROM in an OS 2.1 device (MP2x00, eMate) is installed on a card, with room for four more ROM chips.</p>

<h4 id="IIB6">6) What kind of batteries can I use?</h4>

<p>You can use alkaline batteries, rechargeable batteries (NiCd, NiMH, etc.) or the Apple battery pack. The MP120 &amp; the MP130 can recharge them (with a little piece of paper to press the button under the batteries).</p>

<p>Please note that recharging NiMH batteries in MP1x0s can damage the Newton. [cf: <a href="http://newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk/2002-February/2503.html">NewtonTalk: MP130 Batteries</a>]</p>

<p>Only an original Apple battery pack can be recharged inside the MessagePad 2000 or MessagePad 2100. All other rechargeable batteries require a separate battery charger.</p>

<p>However, according to Nick Müller, it is possible to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030813115541/http://www.logictools.de/newton/akku_mod/akku2k.html">modify an Apple battery pack</a> to use third-party NiHM rechargeable batteries.</p>

<h4 id="IIB7">7) What kind of power adapter can I use?</h4>

<p>The best advice is to use a power adapter that has been specifically designed for use with a Newton device.</p>

<p>Apple manufactured two different adapters:</p>

<p>The “Newton Power Adapter” (model H1300 in North America, model H2200 in Europe) is rated at 7.0V DC, 0.5A. It shipped with the Original MessagePad, MessagePad 100, MessagePad 110, MessagePad 120, and MessagePad 130.</p>

<p>The “Newton 9W Power Adapter” (model H0165) is rated at 7.5V DC, 1.2A. It shipped with the MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, and eMate 300.</p>

<p>There is also an “N2 AC Adapter” which is a prototype version of the 9W adapter with the same model number and power rating. The “N2” adapter accompanied pre-production (EVT/DVT) MessagePad 2000 and 2100 devices. [cf. <a href="#IIA1j">IIA1j</a>]</p>

<p>Both Apple adapters will work in any Newton device. The 9W adapter will recharge batteries faster than the original adapter, except when used with a MessagePad 100.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA36628">Apple MessagePad Devices: Power Adapter Compatibility</a></p>

<p>It is not recommended that you use a third-party adapter. Too many users have inadvertently fried their Newton device using a non-Apple adapter. However, if you want to take the risk, remember that adapters need to be at least 6V DC, 400mA and the plugs are “tip positive”.</p>

<p>Jacek Jadwiszczak reported:</p>

<blockquote>With his MessagePad 120 and 130, he uses a 7V, 3W adapter. Both 7.5V and 6V work fine, but 6V will not charge batteries. Apparently, at least 3W is needed.</blockquote>

<p>Carl Schultz reports:</p>

<blockquote>I have been using a RadioShack AC adapter for almost a year now. It is the 3-12 volt adjustable model. The new model # is 273-1680 ($34.99 list) and is rated at 1000mA. Mine is the older 800mA model but otherwise is the same. The adapter came with several different plug ends, none of which was correct for my MP2000. I had to buy another one, which I don’t have the part number for, but it has a yellow end if that helps (they are all colour coded). This end may now be included with the adapter, since the RadioShack description states that 4 of the included ends are “new”. Make sure that you install the connector in the “tip positive” configuration. I’ve been using mine daily at work with no problems.</blockquote>

<h4 id="IIB8">8) What kind of printers can I use?</h4>

<p>Apple published this support article: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA35200">Newton OS 2.x: Supported Printers</a></p>

<p>There are basically three ways to print things from a Newton:</p>

<p>First, you can print with a serial connection (or an AppleTalk connection — LaserWriter-compatible printers only — or via IrDA if you have a MP2x00/eMate 300). For this, you need a driver. The Newton OS has drivers in the ROM which appear in the list when you select “Choose Other Printer” from the print dialog. There are also drivers written by Apple which can be found on UNNA for the SW4500 &amp; SW6500 and the HP IrDA printers (Newton OS 2.1 devices only): <a href="http://www.unna.org/unna/drivers/printer/">http://www.unna.org/unna/drivers/printer/</a> [I know there’s a non working one for Epson printers, but is there any other driver around?]</p>

<p>Apple also released a PrintPack which includes a serial/parallel adapter and which can print on several parallel printers. The list of printers can be found in the <a href="http://www.unna.org/unna/drivers/printer/PrintPack2/">PrintPack documentation</a> on <a href="http://www.unna.org/">UNNA</a>.</p>

<p>PrintPack 1 was a cable with the drivers included in it. PrintPack 2 requires the drivers to be on the Newton.</p>

<p>Without the hardware, the PrintPack2 drivers are useless. The serial/parallel adapter includes a processor and was manufactured by GDT Softworks (which later became InfoWave) for Apple. This company also manufactured compatible cables, the pre-V.4.X cables. A regular serial/parallel adapter will certainly not work.</p>

<p>About the GDT Softworks cables, Jon Glass reports:</p>

<p>I do recall there being a discussion that the last version of the GDT Softworks version of the PowerPrint adapter wouldn’t work with the Newton. I do know this, the one I have does work with my Epson 900.</p>

<p>I’m having trouble trying to decipher what’s written on the back, so I’ll include all the text:</p>

<p>Advanced Components &amp; Peripherals P/L<br>
Made in Singapore<br>
FCC ID KBVSPC1<br>
P/N: 590-0839<br>
Batch: SPC292<br>
<br>
LR99812</p>

<p>Finally, you you can also print using a PC and Newton PC-Print by Alexander Kunzer.</p>

<p>The HP Deskjet 340CBi is battery powered and has a Newton-compatible IrDA (Newton OS 2.1 devices) adapter.</p>

<h4 id="IIB9">9) Can I use digital cameras with my Newton?</h4>

<p>Yes you can. You need the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010805072031/http://www.compassinfo.com/tibet/">Tibet</a> software. This software is no longer supported, but Russell Tait (the creator of Tibet) gave away some registration codes you can use:</p>

<ul>
	<li>02FDAA084142</li>
	<li>02FDAA090E49</li>
	<li>02FDAA0A1390</li>
</ul>

<p>The following digital cameras will work with a MessagePad 2000 or 2100 and the Tibet software. A serial cable is required to connect the camera to a Newton device.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Agfa ePhoto 307</li>
	<li>Agfa ePhoto 780</li>
	<li>Agfa ePhoto 780c <sup><a href="#IIB9-10">10</a></sup></li>
	<li>Agfa ePhoto 1280</li>
	<li>Agfa ePhoto 1680</li>
	<li>Epson PhotoPC 700</li>
	<li>Fuji</li>
	<li>Nikon CoolPix 800</li>
	<li>Nikon CoolPix 900</li>
	<li>Nikon CoolPix 950</li>
	<li>Olympus D-300L</li>
	<li>Olympus D-320L</li>
	<li>Olympus D-340R</li>
	<li>Olympus D-360L</li>
	<li>Olympus D-450Z</li>
	<li>Olympus C-400</li>
	<li>Olympus C-800L</li>
	<li>Olympus C-1000L</li>
	<li>Olympus C-2500L</li>
	<li>Sanyo VPC-X350</li>
</ul>

<p id="IIB9-10"><sup>10</sup> Neal Sofge reports: “I have an Agfa ePhoto 780c, which is apparently an updated version of the 780 in an iMac-compatible blue case. It works with Tibet, but only if you ‘distract’ the camera by sliding the lens cover open and closed while trying to communicate with it. The timing on this is tricky, but you can get good at it after enough practice.”</p>

<p>It appears that some cameras that use the Fujitsu chipset (such as most of the Olympus models) are also compatible. More information is available on Eugene Crosser’s <a href="http://photopc.sourceforge.net/">Digital Cameras on Fujitsu chipset</a> page.</p>

<p>Canon cameras were once reported as compatible, but Daniel Padilla said they aren’t. At least not his PowerShot 350.</p>

<p>Daniel Padilla also reported that a camera needs to have the Sierra Imaging firmware and a serial port to work with the Tibet software. Here is the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000619203839/http://sierraimaging.com/support/supchimgex.html">list of supported cameras</a>.</p>

<p>The following cameras will definitely not work:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Apple QuickTake Series</li>
	<li>Kodak DC Series</li>
	<li>Connectix QuickCam Series</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="IIB10">10) Can I use a PCMCIA storage card adapter in my Newton?</h4>

<p>Yes. ATA-based storage such as the Iomega Clik!, IBM Microdrive, and CompactFlash can be used with the appropriate PCMCIA adapter and Paul Guyot’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701200025/http://www.kallisys.com/newton/ata/">ATA Support</a> package.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.kallisys.com/files/newton/ATA/ATA-Support-1.0.pkg">ATA Support 1.0</a> package. The <a href="http://www.kallisys.com/files/newton/ATA/ATA-Support-1.0-SourceCode.img.bin">source code</a> is also available.</p>

See also: <a href="#IIB1a">What type of storage cards can I use?</a>

<h4 id="IIB11">11) Are there any accessories that use the Interconnect port?</h4>

<p>Apple only produced two accessories for the Interconnect port, the <a href="#IIA1k">Newton Serial Adapter</a> (colloquially referred to as the “dongle”) and a serial cable with an Interconnect plug on one end and a standard DB-9 connector on the other.</p>

<p>At one point, <a href="http://www.enfour.com/newton/cables/">Enfour</a> also manufactured one-piece serial cables that integrated an Interconnect plug, eliminating the need for the Newton Serial Adapter.</p>

<p>Dave Miller created and iterated his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011024104554/http://www.eskimo.com/~millerd/nicadapter/">line level audio adapter</a> for the MessagePad 2000 and MessagePad 2100. He also put together step-by-step instructions for building your own.</p>

<h4 id="IIB12">12) Can I use a wireless card in my Newton?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can use certain wireless cards just like an <a href="#IIB2c">ethernet networking card</a>. You will need a device running Newton OS 2.1, Newton Internet Enabler (NIE) 2.0, and the <a href="http://www.unna.org/view.php?/drivers/ethernet/WiFi">appropriate driver packages</a> developed by Hirochi Noguchi.</p>

<p>The WaveLAN driver seems to work with most Lucent WaveLAN cards and is designed to connect to a base station. Apple AirPort base stations running software version 1.3 or 2.0 are known to work.</p>

<h4 id="IIB13">13) What cable do I need to connect to my desktop computer?</h4>

<p>Portions of the following are from Apple’s <a href="http://www.unna.org/unna/apple/documentation/misc/AboutCables.pdf">About Cables</a> document. (1995)</p>

<p>You can connect to your Newton using either a serial cable or an ethernet card (connection from a 2.1 device to Mac OS computers only). Please note that using an ethernet card means first installing the proper driver.</p>

<p>The MessagePad 1x0 devices and the eMate 300 have a standrad Mini DIN-8 port compatible with RS-232 and LocalTalk connections. You can use either a Mini DIN-8 to Mini DIN-8 serial cable to connect to an classic Macintosh, a Mini DIN-8 to DB-25 cable to connect to a DB-25 serial port on a Windows computer or a Mini DIN-8 to USB via an USB/Serial adapter to newer machines. You cannot use IrDA with Apple software. See section <a href="newton-faq-nos.html#IIIB3c">IIIB3c</a></p>

<p>The MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, and eMate 300 have an Interconnect port. Using an adapter and the cable supplied with other Newton devices, you can add a standard DIN-8 serial port which is compatible with RS-232, RS-422, GeoPort, and LocalTalk.</p>

<h3 id="IIC">C) Hardware problems</h3>

<h4 id="IIC1">1) Why does my Newton device whine when the backlight is on?</h4>

<p>Newton devices with backlit displays use the same technology that is found in Timex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiglo">Indiglo</a> watches, an Electroluminescent (EL) panel. This type of backlighting operates at a high voltage that requires a voltage conversion circuit, involving a transformer. It’s transformer which creates the whining noise. If you place an Indiglo watch up to your ear, you will hear a similar sound.</p>

<p>Apple Support Tech Note: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA40416">MessagePad and eMate: Noise Emission Levels</a></p>

<h4 id="IIC2">2) Why does my MessagePad 110/120/130 buzz or whine?</h4>

<p>If you are referring to the sound when the backlight is turned on, refer to <a href="newton-faq-hardware.html#IIC1">the previous question</a>. The humming or whine when the MessagePad is powered on is caused by the power manager circuitry. The sound may be more noticeable when the CPU is idle and devices are reportedly noisier than others. Unfortunately, there is no workaround. This issue specifically affects the MessagePad 110, MessagePad 120, and MessagePad 130 models.</p>

<p>Apple Support Tech Note: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA40416">MessagePad and eMate: Noise Emission Levels</a></p>

<h4 id="IIC3">3) What should I do if I have a hardware problem with my Newton?</h4>

<p>It has been years since Apple has provided repair services for Newton devices. You can either attempt repairs yourself or find another individual knowledgable enough to perform those repairs.</p>

<p>Frank Gründel of <a href="https://www.pda-soft.de/">PDA-Soft</a> has provided repair and refurbishing services for Newton devices for many years. <a href="https://www.pda-soft.de/en/email/email.html">Contact</a> him for more information.</p>

<p>You can also try some of the solutions that have been documented for frequent hardware problems. See section <a href="#IIC6">IIC6</a></p>

<h4 id="IIC4">4) Why does my Newton wake up at 3 AM?</h4>

<p>The Newton wakes up to move your to do items over from the previous day, and to perform other housekeeping. [From Robert Sexton’s FAQ]</p>

<h4 id="IIC5">5) How long will the backlight last?</h4>

<p>Alan Drogin says, It has a “half life” conjectured to be in the low thousands of hours. Which translates to at least a couple of years, which also means it doesn’t stop working, just gets dimmer, which ultimately means its within the normal limits of planned obsolescence accepted by the high tech world.</p>

<p>One thing I can’t give a definitive answer to is the actual half life. I’ve seen plenty of posts claiming that the half life of the MP130 backlighting is 1600-1700, but no actual proof of source. I’ve seen claims about the MP2K backlighting at 2000 and even 5000. John Schettino saw some web sites from backlighting manufacturers claiming 15,000-20,000 hour half lives. [From Robert Sexton’s FAQ]</p>

<h4 id="IIC6">6) Common hardware problems</h4>

<h5 id="IIC6a">a) My Newton won’t turn on. What should I do?</h5>

<p>There are a number of things you can try. Try the following, in increasing order:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Put in fresh batteries and plug in the Newton’s power adapter. Turn on the machine.</li>
	<li>With batteries or the power adapter installed, press the reset button. On the original MessagePad, MP100, MP110, MP120, and MP130, the reset button is visible when you remove the battery door. On the MP2000 and MP2100 the reset button is on the underside of the machine.</li>
	<li>For the original MessagePad, MP100, MP110, MP120, and MP130, replace the backup battery. Put in fresh batteries and plug in the Newton’s power adapter. Press the reset button.</li>
	<li>For the MP2000 and MP2100, press and hold the reset button for over twenty seconds. This is a special reset sequence for these machines.</li>
	<li>For the original MessagePad, MP100, MP110, MP120, and MP130, with the batteries or power adapter installed, press and hold the reset button down, then press the power switch. Continue to hold the reset button for two more seconds. Release the reset button. A dialog box appears asking “Do you want to erase data completely?”. Tap the “No” button. (You don’t want to erase your data!)</li>
	<li>For the MP2000 and MP2100 <em>only</em>, remove the battery, cards, and power adapter. Let the Newton sit by itself for a few hours. Leave it a whole day or a whole night if you can. You won’t lose any data. Then put in fresh alkaline batteries, and plug in the power adapter. Press the reset button. This procedure cures nearly every turning-on problem these models have.</li>
	<li>If you have an original MessagePad or a MessagePad 100, see section <a href="#IIC6e">IIC6e</a>.</li>
	<li>For the MessagePad 2000 and MessagePad 2100, <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/">Sean Luke</a> reports that one last resort you can try is to crack it open and see if its daughtercard has become unseated from its slot.</li>
	<li>If your Newton still does not wake up, consider posts to the newsgroups or mailing lists, or consider shipping the unit to Apple.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h5 id="IIC6c">c) How do I turn on the Newton’s backlight?</h5>

<p>The MessagePad 130, MessagePad 2000, MessagePad2100 and eMate 300 include backlit displays. Some third-party devices such as the Digital Ocean Seahorse and Digital Ocean Tarpon also sports backlit displays. [cf. <a href="#IIA1e">IIA1e</a>]</p>

<p>On a MessagePad device, depress and hold the power switch until the backlight is activated. Depress and hold the power switch again to turn off the backlight.</p>

<p>On an eMate 300, press the “lightbulb” button on the keyboard.</p>

<p>The backlight can also be controlled through software. See <a href="newton-faq-hardware.html#IIC6d">the next question</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h5 id="IIC6e">e) Why does my MessagePad 100 turn itself off as soon as I turn it on?</h5>

<p>Older MessagePad devices (in particular, the MessagePad 100) develop power-on problems due to gunk building up inside the power switch which increases its resistance. Sean Luke put together the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/projects/newton/MP100Power.html">The Newton MessagePad 100 Power-Off Page</a> with various workarounds and fixes.</p>

<h5 id="IIC6f">f) The serial port on my MP2000/MP2100 is caved in. What do I do?</h5>

<p>The serial port is poorly soldered onto the MP2K motherboard, and eventually it can wear out and cave in. If you are very, very good at solder, you might try opening the machine and resoldering the contacts. But it’s very difficult, and even proficient solderers won’t attempt it. Most likely, your only recourse is to have Apple fix the problem: see section <a href="#IIC3">IIC3</a></p>

<p>The chief culprit here is the Newton’s “dongle”, the small plug which connects to the Newton. The dongle has two bumps on the top and two bumps on the bottom, which help the dongle stay locked in the serial connector, but cause considerable friction and stress on entry and exit. To prevent problems in the future, you might try filing down the bumps on the top.</p>

<h5 id="IIC6g">g) My MP2000/2100 pen input is all messed up. What can I do?</h5>

<p>This is a problem known as the “Jaggies”. The symptoms are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>invalid pen input, ie. you draw something and the Newton displayssomething totally different</li>
	<li>random pen input appearing when you draw or write</li>
</ul>

<p>It can be caused by two things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>dirt that has collected between the lip of the case and the touchscreen. This can be aggravated by resting your hand on the case while writing, causing the dirt to trigger an unwanted “tap” on the screen</li>
	<li>a warped case that is exerting pressure on the touchscreen, thereby confusing the Newton’s calibration</li>
	<li>a damaged or oxidized touchscreen connector inside your Newton</li>
	<li>a damaged touchscreen</li>
</ul>

<p>If you suspect that dirt is the culprit, you can attempt to clean between the case and the screen:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Remove any screen protectors that are installed.</li>
	<li>Take a thin card (such as a paper business card, nothing thicker than a credit or bank card) and gently insert a corner of it in the gap between the case and the screen. Run the card along all of the edges of the screen — the goal here is to remove any dirt particles that may be wedged between the case and the screen.</li>
	<li>Using a soft cloth, such as a lens or photographic cleaning cloth (not tissue paper!) wipe up the dirt that was dislodged.</li>
	<li>It’s probably a good idea to give the screen a nice cleaning now, before reinstalling your screen protector.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s possible that a warped case is the culprit and <a href="https://marc.info/?l=newtontalk&m=99928252123070&w=2">you can attempt to dewarp it</a>.</p>

<p>If none of this does the trick, then either the touchscreen connector needs cleaning, or the screen must be replaced. Replacing the screen or cleaning the touchscreen should only be attempted by an experienced person, as it required almost complete disassembly of the Newton.</p>

<h4 id="IIC7">7) How do I recondition or rebuild a Newton battery pack?</h4>

<p>Frank Gründel has written several comprehensive guides on rebuilding Newton battery packs.</p>

<h4 id="IIC8">8) Why does my eMate lid make a strange sound? Why does the screen look odd?</h4>

<p>There is a known design flaw in the eMate 300 lid hinge that can cause damage to the flat cable that connects the screen to the main board. More information about this problem and a solution to prevent it can be found on Joel Sciama’s <a href="http://www.inventors-emporium.co.uk/pages/newton-emate-hinge.html">Repairing eMate Hinges and Display Cable</a> page.</p>
