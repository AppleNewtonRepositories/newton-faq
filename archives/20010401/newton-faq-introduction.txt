It is now a huge database of knowledge, including questions you would dare to ask and answers you even ignored. It is by no means a simple newbie only tool, but it includes useful links and can also be used as a bookmark directory.2) Where do I find the latest version?This FAQ is posted as a plain text document monthly on comp.sys.newton.misc, comp.answers and news.answers. The latest text version should be available on MIT FTP <ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/faqs/palmtops/newton/> and on mirrors.There is an additional HTML document which is sent monthly to several popular Newton site webmasters. They upload the latest version depending on their free time, hence the version may differ from one site to another.Those websites are:* PlanetNewton: <http://www.planetnewton.com/FAQ/>* ThisOldNewt (Rich Lindsay): <http://members.aol.com/thisolnewt/FAQ/>* Chris Stephens' site: <http://www.cat2.com/newton/Newton-FAQ/>* Info-Newt (Bill Davis): <http://www.info-newt.com/faq/>* Newton Resources (Victor Rehorst): <http://www.chuma.org/newton/faq/>* Newted Community (Stacey Tenen): <http://newted.dyndns.org/faq/>Mark Rollins compiled it to a Newton Book: <http://www.mrollins.com/newton.html>Additionally, the old archives are saved on Kallisys FTP: <ftp://ftp.kallisys.com/newton/FAQ/Archives/.---------------------------------------------------------------------------B) Sources and special thanks1) Where can I find other Newton FAQs?a) General FAQs:* Robert Sexton wrote a complete FAQ:<http://www.kudra.com/newton/newton-faq>* Andree Dettmer MetaFAQ:<http://homepage.mac.com/dettmer/newton/metafaq.html>* Old FAQ (1995) (useful for 1.x models) by Jean-Christophe Bousson <http://amug.org/amug/sigs/newton/nwtfaq.html.txt>b) Specialized FAQs:* Standalone's FAQ (memory, miscellany):<http://www.standalone.com/support/FAQ/FAQtop.html>* Handwriting recognition tips for the Newton by Hardy Macia at Catamount:<http://www.catamount.com/HWRTips/HWRTips.html>* Daniel Domberger's Newton Heap Mini-FAQ:<http://www.geocities.com/Paris/8382/index.html>* David Arnold's IR FAQ:<http://archive.dstc.edu.au/AU/staff/david-arnold/newton/ir-faq.html>* The Newton Underground's IrDA FAQ [dead link]:<http://resources.pdadash.com/newtund/NU/ncufaq.shtml>* The Newton RAM Page [dead link]:<http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~mdillah/newton.html>* Joseph N.

Also, I'd [PG] like to thank Laura, Steve Weyer and Peter Rand for their support. I also want to thank Robert Sexton for his work (allowing me to complete mine), David Arnold for his complete site for developers, and Rich Lindsay (This Old Newt) for his helpful links. Finally, this FAQ wouldn't have reached this achievement without comments, suggestions, additions and corrections from many Newton Users (more than 20!).
