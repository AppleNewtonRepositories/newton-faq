		<h3><a name="IIIA"></a>A) System Versions</h3>
		<h4><a name="IIIA1"></a>1) What are the different versions of the Newton OS (NOS)?</h4>
		<p>The Newton OS is burned into ROM. Hence the version depends on the model of Newton you have (cf the table of the models). However, some upgrades do exist.</p>

		<h4><a name="IIIA3"></a>3) How do I find out which NOS version I have?</h4>
		<p>This depends on the OS itself.</p>
		<p>If you have a 1.x OS: Go to the preferences. It appears at center-bottom of screen.</p>
		<p>If you have a 2.x OS: Go to the Extras Drawer, select the i button, then Memory Info. You can read something like: ROM Version 2.1 (717260)-1</p>
		<h4><a name="IIIA4"></a>4) What are the differences between the versions of the OS?</h4>
		<h5><a name="IIIA4a"></a>a) NOS 2.x is really different from NOS 1.x</h5>

		<h3><a name="IIIB"></a>B) Using the Newton OS</h3>
		<h4><a name="IIIB1"></a>1) How do I find the Newton's built-in helpbook?</h4>
		<p>Tap the i button in the lower left hand corner of the screen, and then select &quot;help&quot;. This general helpbook is provided in all built-in programs. Some third party programs can also access the built-in helpbook or their own particular helpbook via the i button.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIIB2"></a>2) What are the various ways the Newton can be reset?</h4>
		<p>There are FIVE types or levels of resets. Four of them are described in Apple's article <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n17908">http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n17908</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<p>From the Standalone FAQ: The Newton actually has four different types or levels of resets. The first thing to know about resetting your Newton is that turning your Newton off and on using the power switch is NOT a restart. Unlike other computers, the Newton never completely turns off. It's closer to being in a suspended or sleeping state. It is still able to receive beams, faxes, or wake you up if you configured it to do so.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIB2a"></a>a) Soft Reset</h5>
		<p>This is the most straightforward of the four resets. Just press the &quot;Reset&quot; button on the back of your Newton with your stylus. Alternatively, many software packages have the ability to perform a soft reset.</p>
		<p>A soft reset can be helpful if the Newton becomes sluggish or runs out of heap memory. You will NOT lose any data doing a soft reset.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIB2b"></a>b) Deep Reset</h5>
		<p>The Deep reset is similar to a soft reset. You tap the reset button on the back of the Newton, but this time hold it down for about 20 seconds, until the Newton chimes. This reset is used when there's a power problem with your Newton, or there's a problem when doing a standard restart. It resets at a slightly lower level than a soft reset.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIB2c"></a>c) Reset With Extensions Off</h5>
		<p>A reset with extensions off allows you to reset your Newton but not load any packages. It's as if all packages were frozen. This returns the Newton to an almost virgin state, and is useful if you're having conflicts between two packages, or when you need to maximize heap for a certain procedure. With no packages loaded, your Newton will have it's maximum amount of heap available.</p>
		<p>To perform a reset with extensions off, hit the reset button, on the back of the Newton and then flip the Newton over so the screen is facing you, as for normal usage. Immediately hold the pen down halfway down the left edge of the screen, about a centimeter from the casing, down the screen. Keep holding the pen there, and soon a dialog box will appear asking if you'd like to activate packages on the store &quot;Internal&quot;. Answer &quot;no.&quot; If you have any PC cards installed, return the pen to the left edge and keep holding it down. You'll then get the same dialog for each card. Answer &quot;no&quot; to each. Your Newton now is restarted with no packages loaded.</p>
		<p>You will NOT lose data doing a reset with extensions off. However, if you have a third party application as the Backdrop, (such as Backdrop Plus) it will be replaced with the NotePad, so you'll have to re-designate it as the Backdrop.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIB2d"></a>d) Hard Reset (&quot;Brainwipe&quot;)</h5>
		<p>Before you perform a hard reset, first remove all PCMCIA cards from the Newton (this is <i>really</i> important, otherwise you may destroy the card!).</p>
		<p>This hard reset WILL ERASE EVERYTHING ON YOUR NEWTON. Use it with caution, and usually only as a last resort. If you are performing a Backup and Restore Cycle, you will want to perform a hard reset after the backup and before the restore. Other than that, you will probably never perform one; unless you have major data corruption, or are selling your Newton.</p>
		<p>To perform a Hard reset, tap the reset button, while holding down the power switch. You will be presented with a dialog box asking &quot;Do you want to erase data completely&quot; . Tap Yes if you want to perform the Hard reset and erase everything on the Newton. You will be asked to reconfirm your selection, and then the data will be erased.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIB2e"></a>e) Cold boot</h5>
		<p>(From Apple's article)</p>
		<p>A Cold Boot erases all data, any System Update installed, and sets the Newton OS back to factory defaults. There are two methods to do this.</p>
		<p><b>WARNING:</b> You should backup your data prior to a Cold Boot.</p>
		<p><b>Method 1</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Disconnect any AC power.
			<li>2. Remove the main batteries.
			<li>3. Remove the round Lithium backup battery.
			<li>4. Hold the power switch down for 5 seconds.
			<li>5. Release the power switch.
			<li>6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 four more times.
		</ul>
		<p><b>Method 2</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Disconnect any AC power.
			<li>2. Remove the main batteries.
			<li>3. Remove the round Lithium backup battery.
			<li>4. Let the Apple MessagePad sit this way for 15 minutes.
		</ul>
		<p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>On a MessagePad 120: No data is erased since data is stored in the internal non-volatile Flash RAM.
			<li>On the MessagePad 120, a Cold Boot resets the Power Manager. Pen alignment is required on the next use.
			<li>The Time Zone, Date, Time, and Prefs need to be set up.
		</ul>
		<h4><a name="IIIB3"></a>3) Transferring data to and from the Newton</h4>
		<h5><a name="IIIB3a"></a>a) What are the various methods to input data on the Newton?</h5>
		<p>There are many ways to input data:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>using the stylus and handwriting recognition.
			<li>via the virtual keyboard: some software provide alternate keyboards such as:
			<ul>
				<li>Nick's keyboard
				<li>PowerTrans
				<li>P&amp;M Consulting Foreign Kits. <!--lt-->
				<a href="http://www.pnm-consulting.com/newton/">http://www.pnm-consulting.com/newton/</a><!--gt-->
			</ul>
			<li>Graffiti (cf <a href="#IIIB5">What are the alternatives to the original HWR?</a>)
			<li>Newton keyboard (cf <a href="#IIB3">What kind of keyboard can I use?</a>)
			<li>Desktop keyboard (with NCU - cf <a href="#VB1">Apple's software</a>)
		</ul>
		<h5><a name="IIIB3b"></a>b) What are the various methods of transferring data to/from the desktop?</h5>
		<p>You can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use Newton Connection Utilities to import/export/synchronize data with a MacOS or Windows desktop computer. (cf <a href="#VB1">Apple's software</a>)
			<li>Use Sloup by Steve Weyer to import/export data with most types of desktops using a terminal emulation program such as ZTerm and ClarisWorks for Mac, HyperTerminal for Windows as well as programs for Unix and other platforms. <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/index.htm#Sloup">http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/index.htm#Sloup</a><!--gt-->
			<li>Use Dan Rowley's X-Port program to import/export with Windows or MacOS computers:<br>
			<!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.landware.com/products/xport/xportps.html">http://www.landware.com/products/xport/xportps.html</a><!--gt-->
			<li>Use emails. This can allow you to export packages.
			<li>Use Newton Personnal Data Sharing (NPDS) (a Newton web server!) <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://pop.life.uiuc.edu/~mwvaugh/lightyear/">http://pop.life.uiuc.edu/~mwvaugh/lightyear/</a><!--gt-->
		</ul>
		<h5><a name="IIIB3c"></a>c) Can I use IrDA (infrared) to transfer information between my desktop and my 2.x Newton?</h5>
		<p>This does not seem to be supported by Apple tools (NCU, NBU, etc.).</p>
		<p>It is possible to use a terminal emulator and Sloup to communicate via IrDA: <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/sloup/connect.htm#IrDA">http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/sloup/connect.htm#IrDA</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<h4><a name="IIIB4"></a>4) What are the alternatives to the original HWR?</h4>
		<p>You can use other recognizers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Graffiti available at Newton Cage <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://newtoncage.webjump.com">http://newtoncage.webjump.com</a><!--gt-->
			<br>
			This is the input method used in Palm devices.
			<li>Free Style by ParaGraph <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.landware.com">http://www.landware.com</a><!--gt-->
			<br>
			This input method is used in some WinCE devices.
		</ul>
		<p>You also can use software that improves the Newton's original HWR:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Corrector+ by Foundation Systems <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.tow.com/">http://www.tow.com/</a><!--gt-->
			<li>alt.rec.... by P&amp;M Consulting <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.pnm-consulting.com/newton/">http://www.pnm-consulting.com/newton/</a><!--gt-->
		</ul>
		<h4><a name="IIIB5"></a>5) Can I change the fax cover page?</h4>
		<p>Yes, the necessary program is available at Standalone Software (www.standalone.com ).</p>
		<h4><a name="IIIB6"></a>6) How do I find information about a specific package in Extras?</h4>
		<p>There are several 3rd party utilities that will do this.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>SBM Utilities from Softwareb&uuml;ro M&uuml;ller <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.sbm.nu/">http://www.sbm.nu/</a><!--gt-->
			<li>A free program (for 2.x) is PkgInfo: <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/index.htm#PkgInfo">http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/index.htm#PkgInfo</a><!--gt-->
		</ul>
		<h4><a name="IIIB7"></a>7) How do I take screen shots?</h4>
		<p>You can either use NTK's (Apple Newton ToolKit) Inspector, X-Port or NPDS. X-Port offers the fastest and simplest method of taking screen shots.
		<hr>
		</p>
		<h3><a name="IIIC"></a>C) Troubleshooting</h3>
		<h4><a name="IIIC1"></a>1) Is the Newton Y2K compliant?</h4>
		<p>Apparently so: <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n30338">http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n30338</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<p>However, different date/time related problems might occur starting in 2010, 2099 and 2924 (should you be so lucky to be alive, with a functioning Newton). These problems are discussed here: <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/newtscape/exs/times.htm#Description">http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/newtscape/exs/times.htm#Description</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<p>And Avi Drissman made an experimental fix for that: <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/Fix2010/">http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/Fix2010/</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<h4><a name="IIIC2"></a>2) Are there known bugs in the Newton OS?</h4>
		<h5><a name="IIIC2a"></a>a) I've heard about the nasty -10061 error on MP2x and eMate -- how can I reduce/prevent this?</h5>
		<p>This only happens on devices with 4MB DRAM memory (eMate and 2100 or upgr 2000).</p>
		<p>Information can be found in an article by Frank Wegener translated by George Oehl: <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://home.k-town.de/~oehl/newton/10061.html">http://home.k-town.de/~oehl/newton/10061.html</a><!--gt-->
		 There are fixes such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>'61 Memory Fix v1.0 by Avi Drissman: <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/61MemoryFix/">http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/61MemoryFix/</a><!--gt-->
			<li>Richard Li's SysPatch: <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~clli/syspatch.html">http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~clli/syspatch.html</a><!--gt-->
			<li>Auto61 Fix (Don Vollum). Available at <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.newton-underground.com/NU/extras.shtml">http://www.newton-underground.com/NU/extras.shtml</a><!--gt-->
		</ul>
		<p>Since these programs take different approaches to fixing the -10061 problem, there are generally no conflicts even if you have several of the fixes installed at the same time.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIC2b"></a>b) What is the Dates/Find bug?</h5>
		<p>From Avi's pages:</p>
		<p>The bug is easy to see. Open up the Dates app, tap Find, and do a search for something that will be found in your dates (e.g. the letter &quot;e&quot;). From the list of results, select several and try to print them. Or fax them. Or even preview. It cannot be done. This is fixed by Dates/Find Bugfix: <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/DatesFindBugfix/">http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/DatesFindBugfix/</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIC2c"></a>c) When I write, sometimes pen strokes either do not appear or disappear.</h5>
		<p>This is a known bug. However, as far as I know, nobody has fixed it yet.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIC2d"></a>d) When I do a find with NewtWorks, the free memory amount fails.</h5>
		<p>This seems to be a bug into the Word Processing view from NOS 2.1. It has been said to happen when the Word documents are processed. As far as I know, it has not been fixed yet.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIIC3"></a>3) Packages on other platforms</h4>
		<h5><a name="IIIC3a"></a>a) On my Mac, the icon of a .pkg file is plain, and NPI refuses it.</h5>
		<p>The file's type and creator are not set properly. To fix it, you can use ResEdit and change the settings to &quot;pkg &quot; for the type and &quot;pkgX&quot; for the creator. (this is NPI creator. Some of your packages can have another creator, such as NTK creator code).</p>
		<p>Steve Weyer wrote a simple program, PackType, that does that: <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/index.htm#PackType">http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/index.htm#PackType</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<p>If you don't want this to happen again with your zipped packages or with the packages that you may download, you must add/correct the .pkg entry in the files mappings of Internet Config or Internet Control Panel in the latest MacOS.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIIC3b"></a>b) When I download a .pkg via my Newton web browser, it's not recognized as a package.</h5>
		<p>Assuming the package was properly uploaded as a binary file, then the likely explanation is that the server is not providing the correct MIME type. You can ask the server administrator to use this Content-Type in MIME table: application/x-newton-compatible-pkg or you can contact your browser vendor to support additional MIME types.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIIC4"></a>4) Why does the I/O Box always open to outbox? Can I change that?</h4>
		<p>There was a problem in older versions of Newt's Cape (2.0a, 1.5) -- if you selected a mailto: link, it created a message in your Outbox and opened to that directly.</p>
		<p>Some other softwares could have also changed the default setting which is to open to inbox. <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/newtscape/exs/ioboxfix.htm">http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/newtscape/exs/ioboxfix.htm</a><!--gt-->
		 describes a fix that you can make from a soup editor (or just run the example in Newt's Cape).</p>
		<h4><a name="IIIC5"></a>5) Why does the available memory decrease when the Newton is idle?</h4>
		<p>This kind of memory usage is perfectly normal in a system like Newton that does automatic memory management (also similar to Smalltalk, Lisp, Java). As the event loop runs or even idles, the Newton creates temporary objects. (ala Heisenberg, just observing the state of the Newton in order to update time or amount of heap, uses heap). When this gets to a certain threshhold, the Newton reclaims memory by tracing/discarding items that aren't being referenced anymore by any other object (aka &quot;garbage collection&quot;). [From a developer's perspective, not having to worry about allocating and deallocating memory is great, compared to traditional language environments like C; things just eventually disappear if you stop referencing/using them]</p>
		<p>A real &quot;leak&quot; happens if most of the heap isn't reclaimed. This could happen if an application hangs onto extra, unnecessary stuff even when closed. And this sometimes can happen also during soup (database) processing when the heap becomes partitioned/fragemented (an unfortunate memory management bug that Apple never got around to fixing...)

		<h3><a name="IIID"></a>D) Miscellaneous</h3>
		<h4><a name="IIID1"></a>1) Where can I find informations about Easter Eggs?</h4>
		<p>There are plenty of Easter Eggs in the Newton. Best known are Rosetta!, eclipse, dates prefs, Groom Lake, About Newton?, Egg Freckles &amp; hidden games.</p>
		<p>Here are some links:</p>

			<li>A 2.x easter egg package [if it is the one I have (by Emmanuel Raviart), it enables the Poker &amp; the Patience] <!--lt-->

			<li>To replay an the Eclipse, there's a package 2.x package: <!--lt-->

		<h4><a name="IIID2"></a>2) How are packages compressed? (The story of the compression bits)</h4>
		<p>Packages are compressed when loaded on the Newton (i.e. when transfered from a desktop computer). They are uncompressed on the fly when mapped on the Virtual Memory. This may result in a (little) slow down. The Newton OS compresses packages according to a flag called the compression bit. This flag is set by the programmer in NTK (NDE offers the same option). But it can be set on some packages that were not designed to be compressed.</p>
		<p>Moreover, NOS 2.x packages also have a fast compression bit. Having it set reduces the compression gain, but it is said to speed up things. I have never felt an important change, however.</p>
		<p>Some packages must not be compressed (so wrote Apple's guys in Newton Formats) because they need to be resident. This is very rare, so you may want to compress the uncompressed packages. To do so, you can use a software for MacOS called PackageFlag Changer 0.1a2 that can be found at: <!--lt-->

		<p>Kip at Prism Research enabled compression on some usual uncompressed packages: <!--lt-->
