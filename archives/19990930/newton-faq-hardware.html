		<h5><a name="IIA1b"></a>b) Localized models:</h5>
		<p>Models prior to MP130 were localized in French. All Apple models were localized in German.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIA1c"></a>c) The differences:</h5>
		<p>Physically, 1xx models are smaller than 2k models, and they can are equipped with only one PCMCIA slot. MP 130s and MP2ks are equipped with a backlight. The eMate 300 is equipped with a keyboard, and it looks like the iBook, but smaller.</p>

		<p>*[Robert Sexton's Note] The MP2000/MP2100/eMate has a special connector, known as the interconnect port, which contains the line in, line out, and two serial ports. At the time of this writing, the interconnect port connector is not widely available. The eMate has an interconnect port and a headphone jack.</p>
		<p>The MP2000 memory consists of 1MB of DRAM, and 4mb of Flash RAM The MP2100 memory (and upgraded MP2k) consists of 4MB of DRAM, and 4mb of Flash RAM.</p>

		<h4><a name="IIA3"></a>3) What is the difference between RAM, DRAM, FlashRAM, ROM, SRAM...?</h4>
		<p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is the designation for memory that can be both written to and read. ROM stands for Read Only Memory. ROM cannot be written to. It is used in the Newton for the Operating System. Hence you cannot delete it.</p>
		<p>SRAM stands for Static RAM. It is only used in special cases. On the Newton, such a memory is used for storage purposes on special cards. It is quite slow, and the chip loses its content if the power is not supplied. Hence cards with SRAM have small batteries in them.</p>
		<p>DRAM is for Dynamic RAM. It's the kind of RAM used in desktop computers. It is faster than SRAM, but it needs to be refreshed periodically. It is used on the Newton as the equivalent of the RAM of desktop computers, i.e. if you remove the batteries, the contents will be lost.</p>
		<p>FlashRAM is based on EEPROM technology. It's a kind of memory that does not lose its contents when power is no longer supplied. It is used for storage on the Newton.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIA4"></a>4) What are the Newton's sound capabilities?</h4>
		<p>To record sounds, remember that you'll need a microphone which can only be found on 2.1 devices.</p>
		<p>Software which allows you to record and playback sounds:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Newton's built-in recording stationary (NOS 2.1)
			<li>VoiceNotes (by Ebb Data Systems) dramatically improves the Newton's recording quality, and uses memory much more efficiently than the built-in recording stationary, thereby turning the Newton into a useful digital recorder. <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.ebb-ubb.com/ebb">Ebb Data Systems</a><!--gt-->
			<li>The freeware program ModPlayer by Roger Milne lets you play MOD files directly on your Newton. <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Code/5100/">ModPlayer</a><!--gt-->
			<li>There is currently an MP3 project to develop a player for the Newton OS.
			<li>There are also various sound packages available. Search the DNUG site for sounds such as:
			<ul>
				<li>StarWars/Babylon 5/StarTrek/Simpsons
				<li>Shane Hill sounds: <!--lt-->
				<a href="http://members.tripod.com/SDHEngSoft/">http://members.tripod.com/SDHEngSoft/</a><!--gt-->
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>The freeware program VoiceAlarm by Serg Koren lets you record sounds which can be used as alarm sounds on the Newton. <!--lt-->

				<li>Make-your-own audio adaptor (Dave Miller). This site provides advice how to make a headphone jack for your Newton: <!--lt-->

		<h3><a name="IIB"></a>B) Extending MessagePad hardware</h3>
		<h4><a name="IIB1"></a>1) What kind of memory cards can I use in my Newton?</h4>
		<h5><a name="IIB1a"></a>a) What cards are suitable for the Newton?</h5>
		<p>You can use SRAM cards or FlashRAM cards. SRAM cards are more expensive than FlashRAM cards, and they need an internal battery.</p>
		<p>There are several kinds of flash memory cards available today. There are ATA flash cards, compact flash cards, SmartMedia flash cards and linear flash cards. Linear, ATA and compact cards are the same size, but only linear (or regular) cards can be used in Newton Message Pads. There are two common kinds of linear cards, depending on the chip used in it. There are AMD series D or AD linear Cards (also known as 5v/5v) and Intel Series II/II+ (also known as 5v/12v).</p>
		<h5><a name="IIB1b"></a>b) What sizes and models are suitable for my Newton?</h5>
		<p>5v/12v cards can be used on all models except eMate 300. 5v/5v cards can be used on eMate, MP2k and MP130. SRAM cards can be used on all Newtons. SRAM cards only work if they are 4 MB or smaller. You need Newton OS 2.x to use flash cards bigger than 4 MB. The maximum is 32 MB.</p>
		<p>Some MP120s with NOS 2.0 could also use 5v/5v cards. But this is not sure at all.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIB1c"></a>c) Can I increase internal DRAM memory?</h5>
		<p>You can increase the DRAM memory of the MP2000 by doing the MP2100 upgrade. Some companies sell the kit or do the upgrade such as PixSolutions <!--lt-->

		<h5><a name="IIB2b"></a>b) Which cell phones can I use?</h5>
		<p>Here's a summary of cell phone compatibility for the Newton. Information on modems and drivers are further below. Thanks to all the individual contributors who provided info about their cell phones.</p>

			 (David Rouse)</i><br>
			I've had excellent results with a Motorolla 'Micro TAC Alpha' (flip phone, on the larger side) and a CELLect 14.4 PCMCIA modem card (which has a neat geeky manual, it even covers UUCP). Both products are, I believe, as discontinued as the Newton itself.

			I have had some success with a Motorola DPC650, a MOT-1 cable from Megahertz and a Megahertz XJ4288 modem. Dials great, connects great, but the cellular connection is slow, and unless I'm near a cell tower, it can drop in the middle of the transfer. I used both the 14.4 and higher setting, and the CruiseCard 28.8 setting with success. I have also had success with a Motorola &quot;black box&quot; with just about all PC card modems I have used. Let me know if you need the part number for it, because I keep it in my car.
			<li>Motorola 6200, 8200, 8400, 8700, 8900<br>

			I'm using the CEllect 1+ card and a Newton 130 with a driver I found in a free data-base a year ago. (sorry, I don't remember the URL) I put up a page with those informations here: <!--lt-->
			<a href="http://jetai.unipv.it/falzoni/cellect.html">http://jetai.unipv.it/falzoni/cellect.html</a><!--gt-->
			 Feel free to copy any information/driver from this page. I don't know if the driver works with other models of Newton/cellect. I only tested these phones: motorola 6200, 8200, 8400, 8700, 8900 and flare. 100% ok with my CELLect 1+ card and MP 130.

			Nokia 2110 and 2110i with an Nokia DTP-2 PC Card works like a charm with an Newton too.<br>
			Also Options 33.6K PC Card modem with &quot;GSM ready&quot; logo onto them, with GSM cable for Siemens S4, works with Option drivers from www.novamedia.de. Both as a standard 33.6K modem, as an cellular. Haven't tried anything else than an S4, but presume that , as you just change cable, it would work with any cellular that Option has an cable for. Both data and fax, in both cases, I might add.<br>

			<li>Nokia 880, 2110(i), 3110, 3810, 5000, 8110(i), 8146, 8148i - and clones like Technophone, some Philips models.<br>

			Nokia 880, 2110(i), 3110, 3810, 5000, 8110(i), 8146, 8148i models works with DTP-2 ver.II Nokia Cellular Data Card and Nokia GSM ISDN driver. Nokia 880, 2110(i), 5000 (this might be Mobira Cityman not Nokia) and 2110 -clones like Technophone, some Philips-models work with DTP-2 Nokia Cellular Data Card and Nokia GSM Auto driver. These might work (and probably will) with each others drivers. The Nokia 6150 can be connected with TDK, option and some other 3rd party PC Card. These cards support several other brands and models. The Motorola 8700 - All Motorola phones which support Cellect PC Card are supported by gsm-motorola driver. Some future and currently available phones which has built-in modem should be compatible. These phone are Nokia 7110, Siemens S25, Bosch 909. None of the phones above can use IrDA to communicate because of the un-complete IrDA support on Newtons. Obviously some Ericsson models are supported because there's such thing as gsm-ericsson driver available. I have no idea which phones.

		<h4><a name="IIB3"></a>3) What kind of keyboard can I use?</h4>
		<p>The eMate has a keyboard built-in. No other Newtons do.</p>
		<p>Apple Computer made a special optional keyboard which can be plugged into the MP2k's serial port -- no other keyboard can be used.</p>
		<p>You can also use a keyboard with MP120 w/ NOS 2.0 &amp; MP130.</p>
		<p>There are hacks (software and/or hardware?) which allows one to use this keyboard with earlier Newtons as well.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIB4"></a>4) Can I speed up the processor?</h4>
		<p>Yes, PixSolutions <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://www.pixsolutions.com/english.html">http://www.pixsolutions.com/english.html</a><!--gt-->
		 or <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://www.pixsolutions.com/">http://www.pixsolutions.com/</a><!--gt-->
		 offers kits to speed up the MP2ks and MP130s. They can install it.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIB5"></a>5) Can I change the ROM of the Newton?</h4>
		<p>Theoretically, the ROM of Newton MP 120 can be changed from Newton OS 1.3 to Newton OS 2.0. But you've got to find a ROM chip to do this. Other ROM chips on OMP and MP110 are soldered to the motherboard.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIB6"></a>6) What kind of batteries can I use?</h4>
		<p>You can use alkaline batteries, rechargeable batteries (NiCD, NiMH, ...) or the Apple battery pack. The MP120 @amp; the MP130 can recharge them (maybe with a little hardware hack).</p>
		<p>Only the Apple battery pack can be recharged inside the MP2k. For all other batteries you will need a separate battery charger, or to modify the battery holder as described by Nick M&uuml;ller: <!--lt-->

		</p>
		<h4><a name="IIB7"></a>7) What kind of adapters can I use?</h4>
		<p>The best advice is to use Apple's original adapter. Too many Newtons have had their power supplies fried using third party adaptors. However, if you want to try at your own risk, please note that, on MP2k, adapters should have the following characteristics:</p>
		<p>(-)==( *--(+), 5V DC, 400 mA [that's one of mine, but lower power could also work]</p>
		<p>With his MP120 &amp; MP130, Jacek Jadwiszczak uses a 7V, 3W. Also: 6V works (but no charging batteries) and 7.5V works just fine, always at least 3W are needed. Please note that he hadn't give me the polarity yet, and in all cases, nusing a third party adapter could fry your Newton</p>
		<h4><a name="IIB8"></a>8) What kind of printer can I use?</h4>
		<p>You can use any driver that appears in the list when you select &quot;Choose Other Printer&quot; from the print dialog. The printer should be linked by a serial cable. You can use other printers with a serial/parallel adapter and the PrintPack 2.0 from Apple. You can also use other printers with specific drivers. You can also print using a PC and Newton PC-Print by Alexander Kunzer: <!--lt-->

		</p>
		<h4><a name="IIB9"></a>9) Can I use digital cameras with my Newton?</h4>
		<p>Yes you can. You need Tibet Software. This software is no longer supported, and you can't get a registration code.</p>
		<p>The following digital cameras will work with a MP2k and Tibet software:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Agfa 1280
			<li>Nikon CoolPix 900
			<li>Canon
			<li>Fuji
		</ul>
		<p>The following cameras will not work:
		<ul>
			<li>QuickTakes
			<li>Kodaks

		<h3><a name="IIC"></a>C) Hardware problems</h3>
		<h4><a name="IIC1"></a>1) Why does my MP130/MP2000/eMate whine when the backlight is on?</h4>
		<p>(From Robert Sexton's FAQ) Backlit Newtons use the same technology that is found in indiglo watches. The backlighting uses high voltages, and this requires a transformer which makes the noise. If you listen carefully to an indiglo watch, you will notice the same effect.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIC2"></a>2) Why does my MP120/130 whine?</h4>
		<p>(From Robert Sexton's FAQ) If you are referring to the sound made by the backlighting (on MP130), see previous question. The humming when the MessagePad operates (More noticeable when the CPU is idle) is caused by a small power transformer. Its a bit annoying, but there is no workaround for it. Some MessagePads are reportedly noisier than others. This affects the MP110-MP130.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIC3"></a>3) What should I do if I have a hardware problem with my Newton?</h4>
		<p>Apple can still repair Newton devices, for seven years after they announced the discontinuation of the Newton platform.</p>
		<p>To arrange the repair, call 1-800-767-2775 and request technical support. When you talk to someone, tell them you're calling for a Newton. They should arrange to have the Newton repaired. If things don't go as expected, call the Apple Repair Center in Memphis that handles Newton repairs at 800-233-6555. The people that answer the phone are not very cooperative or knowledgeable. They serve as a barrier between you and the actual staff that perform the repair. Insist on talking to a supervisor if you're not pleased with the answers they give you.</p>
		<p>(Thanks to Laurent Daudelin)</p>
		<p>In Europe, contact ADT, the Apple Repair center: <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://www.euro-adt.com">http://www.euro-adt.com</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<p>Considering the fee they will ask, you can try the following solutions to the frequent hardware problems.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIC4"></a>4) Why does my Newton wake up at 3 AM?</h4>
		<p>(From Robert Sexton's FAQ) The Newton wakes up to move your Todos over from yesterday, and do other housekeeping.</p>
		<h4><a name="IIC5"></a>5) How long will the backlight last?</h4>
		<p>(From Robert Sexton's FAQ) <!--lt-->
		<a href="mailto:drogin@panix.com">drogin@panix.com</a><!--gt-->
		 (Alan Drogin) says, It has a &quot;half life&quot; conjectured to be in the low thousands of hours. Which translates to at least a couple of years, which also means it doesn't stop working, just gets dimmer, which ultimately means its within the normal limits of planned obsolescence accepted by the high tech world.</p>
		<p>One thing I can't give a definitive answer to is the actual half life. I've seen plenty of posts claiming that the half life of the MP130 backlighting is 1600-1700, but no actual proof of source. I've seen claims about the MP2K backlighting at 2000 and even 5000. John Schettino saw some web sites from backlighting manufacturers claiming 15,000-20,000 hour half lives.</p>
		<p>[Robert Sexton Note] EnFour (Who would like to sell you a new backlighting element), claims that the standard backlighting has a half life of 1000 hours. They offer replacements in a variety of colors, and claim slightly lower power consumption with a 2000-4000 hour half life.</p>

		<h4><a name="IIC6"></a>6) Common hardware problems</h4>
		<h5><a name="IIC6a"></a>a) My Newton won't wake up. What should I do?</h5>
		<p>First, try to plug the Newton with the adapter or replace the batteries.</p>
		<p>Second, start to press the reset button (on the back with MP 2k, under the batteries with MP 1xx [and where with eMates?]) For the MP2K, try pressing the reset button for over 20 seconds.</p>
		<p>Third, try to leave the Newton alone for a while without batteries, cards and adapter. The definition of <i>for a while</i> may vary between a quarter or few hours. Leave it a whole day or a whole night if you can.</p>
		<p>If it still does not wake up, consider posts to the newsgroups or mailing lists, or consider shipping the unit to Apple.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIC6b"></a>b) How do I protect my MessagePad screen?</h5>
		<p>Try to use a screen protector, such as WriteRights by Concept Kitchen <!--lt-->
		<a href="http://www.conceptkitchen.com">http://www.conceptkitchen.com</a><!--gt-->
		 or the Barrier by RoadRunner Tracks <a href="http://www.roadrunnertracks.com">http://www.roadrunnertracks.com</a><!--gt-->
		 or NuShield Screen Protectors by Mark Ross <!--lt-->

		, <!--lt-->
		<a href="mailto:bymarkr13@voicenet.com">mailto:bymarkr13@voicenet.com</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<p>You can also use a Digital Writer by A.T. Cross to protect the screen against damage in the first place (digital writers are inserts for Cross pens. About $6 each.) Order digital writers from Norma Houle <!--lt-->
		<a href="mailto:nhoule@cross.com">nhoule@cross.com</a><!--gt-->
		</p>
		<p>The Francophone Newton User Group (GFUN) has a page to explain how to make your own screen protector: <!--lt-->

		</p>
		<h5><a name="IIC6c"></a>c) How do I turn on the Newton's backlight ?</h5>
		<p>Backlights are included in MP2ks and MP130s. Just depress the power switch until the backlight is activated. To switch it off, do the same. The backlight can also be activitated through software such as BackLight (Sean's Utilities) by Sean Breen or Avi's Backdrop by Avi Drissman.</p>
		<h5><a name="IIC6d"></a>d) Why does my MP100 turn itself off as soon as I turn it on?</h5>
		<p>Old MessagePads (in particular, MP100s) develop power-on problems due to gunk building up inside the power switch which raises its resistance. Sean Luke maintains a web page with workarounds and outright fixes at <!--lt-->
